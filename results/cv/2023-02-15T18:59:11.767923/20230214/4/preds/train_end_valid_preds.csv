INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with1 channel of EKG. The patient appears drowsy and is not able to cooperate with hyperventilation or photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm. There is a small amount of theta. The patient drifts off into sleep and a lower voltage slow pattern is noted. In the transition out of sleep, there are bursts of beta activity in the central regions which are relatively symmetric but there are also some
bursts of 8 Hz activity in the left frontotemporal region. This activity is seen as the patient transitions towards stage 2 sleep with abundant vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS. The patient transitions in and out of stage 2 sleep. Photic stimulation does arouse the patient but does not produce a driving response.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient had one of her behavioral events during the EEG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a symmetric, 11 Hz, 70 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm. Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces a great deal of blinking. Brief drowsiness is characterized by a small amount of theta and some bursts of rhythmic, hypnagogic hypersynchrony. Photic stimulation elicits abundant, symmetric driving. The patient has an event during photic stimulation characterized by frequent eye blink. The eye blink frequency increases after the photic stimulation stops. She has shaking of her legs and impaired responsiveness. This is followed by moaning. No epileptiform features are associated with these behaviors. The EEG demonstrates a normal awake pattern throughout these behaviors which began at 11:44. unfortunately, the camera is primarily on her face and upper body and this is the lower extremity activity. Afterward, the patient has intermittent arm shaking noted at 11:47, again difficult to see on the camera. Afterward she feels drained and tired but the EEG continues to demonstrate a normal awake pattern.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 26-year-old right-handed man with a history of head trauma from car accident.  The patient stated that he started having seizure-like activity after car accident.
MEDICATIONS:  The patient's medications include Xanax.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the laboratory using the standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to T1 and T2 electrodes and 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation was performed.  Photic stimulation was not performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through stage II of sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 12 Hz in frequency, 30-40 microvolts in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Stage 1 sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and posts.  Stage 2 sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes, sleep spindles, and posts.  Hyperventilation results in symmetrical slowing of the background.  Heart rate is 70 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through a stage 2 sleep.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy, if seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat EEG or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a routine outpatient EEG with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  Impedances were acceptable aside from the T1 and T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  In relaxed wakefulness and early drowsiness, rhythmic midtemporal theta activity was noted with 5 Hz activity seen infrequently, left more so than the right.  Stage 2 sleep was captured at the close of the recording with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  No temporal theta was noted at that time.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting off to sleep, but produced vigorous bilateral driving response with supraharmonic driving.  Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background.
Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through brief stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the third EEG for this subject which did not identify epileptiform activity.  The rhythmic midtemporal theta noted in drowsiness is a normal variant.
