MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Heparin, Nifedipine, Lisinopril, Insulin, Protonix, ASA


INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation is completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is mildly slow with a posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 7.5 Hz. The patient is quite drowsy and rapidly drifts off into a drowsy pattern over steeper stages of sleep. Photic stimulation elicits an unilateral driving response, better elicited on the left compared to the right. In addition, the photic stimulation serves to alert the patient, at which point the left hemisphere seems to generate faster frequency better than the right.

HR:	58 bpm


IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Generalized background slowing and disorganization.
2. 	Disruption of faster frequency activity on the right supporting a cortical process.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The patient's hypersomnolence is more of a clinical issue. There are no epileptiform features noted. The focal features described above may be correlated with imaging.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background includes a 10-Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is continuous skull defect at C3-T3 with higher amplitude activity in that region. Underlying this there is also a subtle disruption of faster frequency activity and some rhythmic focal slowing which is sharply contoured. There is also a subtle amount of slowing in the right.
Hyperventilation produces an accentuation of the rhythmic slowing in the left temporal region as well as bursts of rhythmic generalized slowing. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing. In drowsiness the focal slowing is more prominent in the left midtemporal region.
Photic stimulation elicits driving which is best identified on the right but is relatively
subtle.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This EEG is recorded at multiple sections.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: EEG characteristics of the seizures include rhythmic, repetitive, theta frequency, activity primarily from the left hemisphere including left frontotemporal. Some of this also involved delta. Most seizures seem to be about 2 minutes in duration and demonstrate frequent evolution. There is little in the way of postictal confusion, and the postictal background is actually quite symmetric with a definable posterior dominant rhythm. The degree of focal slowing in the left hemisphere is quite variable. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. During the later portions of the record, because the patient is having recurrent seizures, the technologist switches over the electrodes to collodion one-by-one during the continuous record. The seizures are characterized by head turning and confusion. The patient is aphasic but she is communicative before and after the seizures, and even during the seizures she seems to be making an attempt to communicate.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake but uncomfortable. Hyperventilation and photic simulation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow with a rhythmic theta  frequency pattern. There are bursts of bilateral, frontally predominant rhythmic delta. In addition, there are bursts of high amplitude delta activity in the right hemisphere with a generous field of spread. Some of these are associated with sharp waves in the right hemisphere including right central and parietal regions. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta frequency activity. As the recording continues sharp waves are noted with different localizations including FP2, F8 and T4. The transition to stage II sleep Is associated with vertex waves and spindles followed by arousal.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Prominent epileptiform activity in the right hemisphere with a generous field of spread.
3. FIRDA
4. High amplitude delta in the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are to the previous EEGs performed in July 2009. No seizures were recorded. The studies a localization related mechanism for epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are both attempted.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG is disorganized. There is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm but there is variability in the alpha rhythm and excess theta. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increase in rhythmicity. In addition, in hyperventilation there is some focal slowing identified in the right frontotemporal region with rare sharp waves. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response which is relatively symmetric but may be a bit more vigorous on the left. This is followed by some drowsiness.

HR: 96 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. Focal slowing in the right frontotemporal region.
3. Rare right frontotemporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports both a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as well as a structural process in the right frontotemporal or frontocentral region. Correlation with imaging is suggested. If this patient is thought to be postictal, a follow-up study may be considered.

MEDICATIONS: Vesicare, Carbamazepine, Nifedical, Ibuprofen
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm. In wakefulness there are also right anterior temporal sharp waves. During the hyperventilation part of the record there is an area of initially a low voltage, slightly irregular slowing out of the right central temporal region, followed by more rhythmic activity of initially 2-3 Hz, and then higher amplitude activity of increasing
rhythmicity in hyperventilation, which is in the right central temporal region. This activity out of the right central region occurs in the context of generalized, frontally predominant rhythmic slowing. In the post hyperventilation record, there is prominent rhythmic 7 Hz activity out of the left central region and then more definitive Mu like activity which can be seen bilaterally. The activity that looks like Mu on the left Is a lower voltage from that on the right, although the frequency is identical. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta frequency activity. Photic stimulation elicits supraharmonic driving.
HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rare right temporal sharp waves.
2. Subtle underlying focal slowing in the right central temporal region.
3. An unusual Mu activity that is slower that it is typically expected in higher amplitude  on the right.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The sharp waves should be correlated in this patients history, but support a focal mechanism for epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This an awake and sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.7 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. A breech rhythm can be identified from the left frontal region and there is a subtle area of focal slowing with some rhythmic 3-4Hz activity in that region. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background theta. The breech rhythm is a bit more prominent in drowsiness, as is some of the rhythmic slowing. Photic stimulation elicits driving bilaterally. Again, the breech rhythm is a bit more prominent. At the close of the record the patient starts to drift off into stage 2 sleep. The field of the left frontal focal slowing actually increases a bit more posteriorly in sleep.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is excessively drowsy and there is a great difficulty keeping the patient awake.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: When the patient is resting comfortably, there is a more pattern of diffuse beta. Features of stage 2 sleep include vertex waves and spindles. There is an artifact picked up intermittently in the record. It looks like IV drip artifact, but it is picked up in the eye movements and it confounds some of the activity seen in the left temporal region. Hyperventilation is attempted unsuccessfully because of the patient's drowsiness. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting off to sleep.

identified bilaterally. There is a muscle artifact picked up with scalp electrode artifact at T3 almost continuously. There is also a bit of a breach with accentuation of beta
particularly in the frontal regions. In hyperventilation there is a bit of focal slowing
picked up primarily in the left parietal rhythm followed by rhythmic frontal theta.
Prolonged stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves and spindles. The patient's breach
rhythm is quite apparent there with higher amplitude activity in the left central region.
Photic stimulation produces scant bilateral driving.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:  1. Left parietal subtle focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The subtle left frontal features were not identified today. No epileptiform features were noted. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing may be of use, but in any case the most recent EEGs have been without
epileptiform activity.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old male with tonic-clonic seizure and postictal state.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Keppra.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record in an individual who is quite sleepy. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is quite drowsy at the beginning of the record with an overall slow background with delta and smaller amounts of theta. There is a suggestion of an asymmetry with a little slower activity on the right than the left. The background EEG is abnormal and includes primarily a theta frequency pattern with a glimpse of an alpha rhythm. The alpha rhythm is somewhat slow at 7Hz.

There are focal epileptiform features observed in this record. These include discrete high amplitude right anterior temporal spike and slow wave complexes, right occipital spike and slow wave complexes and some bifrontal sharp waves, left higher amplitude than the right.

Hyperventilation seems to accentuate the epileptiform activity from the frontal and occipital regions. Photic stimulation does not produce a driving response but may also accentuate the epileptiform activity.

As the recording continues, the patient starts to arouse spontaneously with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a background with excess beta. Intermittently a bit of rhythmic slowing is observed in the right hemisphere particularly the posterior temporal.

Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is asleep and does not significantly activate the record. Toward the close of the record, there is a suggestion of sharp waves on the right, but unfortunately there is also electrode artifact.

HR: 96 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Abnormal background.
2. Focal epileptiform activity including frontal, temporal or occipital.
3. Excess beta.
4. Initially excess slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is certainly a suggestion of slowing on the right, however, there are some technical limitations of this record. To more completely evaluate this patientÕs underlying epilepsy, a followup study is suggested.

The epileptiform activity described today has been previously noted. Of note, the temporal epileptiform activity is much more prominent. No occipital seizures were noted and the patient is not experiencing refractory headaches at this time.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is somnolent and uncomfortable. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG does demonstrate posteriorly predominant delta, more so in the right posterior region than the left. On the left, there is a glimpse of an alpha rhythm identified. The alpha rhythm is, however, somewhat slow. As the recording continues, the patient is uncomfortable with head shaking from side-to-side obscuring parts of the EEG. As the recording continues, the intrahemispheric asymmetry becomes a bit more prominent particularly as the patient becomes a little drowsy and there is 11 Hz activity noted in the background on the left which is absent on the right and there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm discernible on the left on occasion.
HR: 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Superimposed focal slowing particularly from the right posterior quadrant.
3. Intermittent slowing from the left posterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features in this challenging EEG. The findings described above are compatible with an occipital process involving the gray and white matter as would be seen in the context of acute ischemia.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is slow and disorganized with rhythmic 3 Hz to 5 Hz activity. The overall shape of the cranium is markedly asymmetric and there is a previous ventriculostomy but there is also a sharp wave focus in the right central region which is quite prominent throughout the EEG. Lateral rectus eye movement artifact is also observed bilaterally. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.

HR: 120 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Prominent sharp waves from the right central region.
2. Bilateral background slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function congruent with the imaging. The epileptiform activity emanates from the right.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. The patient is described as having a low blood pressure during the test. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and does appear to accentuate some subtle, left temporal focal slowing. In addition, hyperventilation produces rhythmic background slowing and then as the patient becomes drowsy with an increase in intermittent beta, intermittently, the left temporal rhythmic slowing is identified. POSTS are observed in stage 1 sleep. Interestingly, they are higher amplitude on the left than the right. Vertex waves and spindles are seen in brief stage 2 sleep. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving despite the fact that the patient is in and out of stage 2 sleep during photic stimulation.

HR: 62 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic left temporal focal slowing noted pre, post, and during hyperventilation.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to previous EEGs although no sharp waves were seen today and are relatively characteristic of temporal lobe epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. From the best Information that can be determined, the patient has not been in barbiturate coma since last week.

DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a burst suppression pattern with bursts of faster frequency activity, bursts of theta frequency activity, and an amplitude asymmetry sometimes higher amplitude on the right compared to the left Tactile stimulation of the patient does not particularly change the record. Average duration of suppressions is 1-3 seconds and average duration of cerebral activity tends to be around 3 seconds. The overall pattern is not completely flat. Rare sharp waves are observed. The physical examination demonstrates an intubated comatose patient and it is not possible to determine if the patient has eye deviation during the EEG.

HR: 75 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Discontinuous bursts suppression pattern.
2. Low voltage pattern.
3. Rare sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: If in fact the patient is receiving sedative hypnotic doses of propofol, then that would certainly account for the burst suppression pattern obtained.

Patient was admitted January 6, 2011, with craniotomy defect, confusion, DVT, and stroke.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lasix, Metoprolol, K-Dur
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat disorganized. Despite a breach rhythm, there is a well-defined left anterior temporal sharp wave noted in wakefulness. Other features of this record include bursts of paroxysmal sharply-contoured slowing out of the left temporal region which occur without a clear clinical correlate. Because of the prominent eye-blink, attempt is made to reduce this. No clinical features are seen in association with the eye-blink artifact.
Following this, the patient becomes drowsy. There is an increase in background slowing. In drowsiness, the epileptiform activity demonstrates a more extensive field of thread, other anterior temporal or centroparietal in nature. No additional paroxysmal bursts of slowing are noted.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Sharp waves identified from the left temporal region which may be anterior temporal, centroparietal, or posterior temporal.
2. Bursts of paroxysmal slowing in the left temporal region without clinical correlate.
3. Epileptiform activity in the left mid-to-anterior-temporal region as well as posterior temporal region.
4. Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG suggests a prominent, epileptogenic or epileptiform process on the left. No clinical seizures were recorded. Ongoing vigilance is appropriate.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is abnormal and includes multiple focal features. A breech rhythm is identified from the right central region with prominent accentuation of faster frequency activity. There is also some underlying slowing, particularly in the right central temporal, and posterior temporal region. The alpha rhythm on the left is somewhat slow, 7.5 Hz, and the alpha rhythm on the right is intermittently disrupted. There is some sharply contoured slowing and a T4 sharp wave noted in relaxed wakefulness. Features of drowsiness include an increase in rhythmicity. There is some shilling slowing noted from either hemisphere, particularly the central regions. Photic stimulation produces scant driving. Occasional right temporal sharp waves are noted during photic stimulation.
HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Shifting focal slowing.
3. Right temporal sharp waves.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Much of the record includes relaxed wakefulness or drowsiness. In this drowsy state there is more of a theta and beta frequency pattern. In addition, there are bursts of sharply contoured focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region. Some of the bursts occur with pairs or brief bursts of sharply contoured theta frequency activity. Photic stimulation produces scant driving, as well as some electrode artifact. The left anterior temporal, irregular, sharply contoured slowing is identified at that time as well. There appears to be a T1/T3 sharp wave mixed with this. As the patient becomes a bit more drowsy, there is also some rhythmic theta in the left frontal region. The normal testing to search for an alpha rhythm was not performed. Spontaneous eye opening and eye closure was identified, but there appeared to be scant, lower voltage, 10.5 Hz alpha activity, better defined on the right compared to the left.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow with excess theta and a poorly defined 9Hz alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation is performed early-on in the record, clearly accentuating rhythmic mixed theta delta from the right temporal region as well as left temporal sharp waves. Following hyperventilation, the sharp waves and the rhythmic slowing gradually abate and the patient becomes somewhat drowsy. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Rhythmic theta and delta primarily from the right temporal region.
3. Right temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings were seen in previous EEGs. Of note, only 2 of this patient's previous 11 EEGs were available for review today but the findings are similar in this individual with known, refractory temporal lobe epilepsy and previous, unilateral or bitemporal findings.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well-organized but somewhat slow with a 7.5 Hz alpha rhythm, a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity and excess theta. Technically, this is a good quality study with symmetric pattern. Occasional lambda Is noted. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. A single left frontally frontocentral sharp wave maximum at F7, FT1 is observed in this EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: A single sharp wave should be considered artifactual and not epileptiform if there is only one. This sharp wave, however, is well-defined with an after going slow wave. This is the third EEG for this patient and the first to demonstrate epileptiform activity which is well-defined. This appears to be a satisfactory localization of this person's epilepsy despite the shortcomings described above.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow and disorganized. It is primarily a theta delta pattern with a glimpse of a 9 hertz alpha rhythm on the right. There seems to be a breech rhythm with higher amplitude activity on the left compared to the right. Sharp waves are identified most of which have a T1 phase reversal, but there are a handful of sharp waves which start at T2, lower voltage and then higher amplitude, left anterior temporal T2-F7. The sharp waves seem to be accentuated by hyperventilation. The focal slowing on the left is also accentuated by hyperventilation. Although there is no mention of a previous craniotomy, there is higher amplitude activity on the left and as the patient becomes drowsy, there is a bit more focal left frontal temporal delta. Photic stimulation produces scant driving more apparent on the right than the left.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Focal slowing on the left compared to the right.
3. Sharp waves seem primarily from the left, but some of which start on the right and end on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a focal process on the left involving gray and white matter. In addition, the overall background is slow suggesting a bihemispheric process. Correlation with imaging is appropriate, but overall, this EEG supports a focal mechanism for seizures.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 hertz alpha rhythm.
Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increase in background slowing. In addition, the breach rhythm and focal slowing from the left hemisphere particularly frontocentral and frontotemporal is noted. There is also some shifting slowing. In hyperventilation, there is a suggestion of underlying sharp wave in the left frontocentral and frontotemporal region, but unfortunately, these areas are also seen in areas with a breach rhythm. As the patient becomes drowsy, wicket is also noted in the frontocentral and frontotemporal region, again with the same caveat of the breach accentuating the amplitude.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG opens to a diffuse slow background with an asymmetric pattern over each hemisphere.  The left hemisphere is mainly in the theta-delta frequencies with maximum slowing seen in the left midtemporal region.  The right hemisphere reveals a low-voltage discharge with minimal normal cortical frequencies seen, mainly in the delta frequency.
No normal posterior dominant rhythm is seen and normal frontocentral beta is absent.  At times the patient coughs and the frequencies appeared to improve to a theta pattern.  No normal sleep architecture was seen, and no activating procedures were performed.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction in the left hemisphere, maximum in the temporal region, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology but has a high correlation with a lesion in that region.  The right-sided attenuation may be due to cortical dysfunction sometimes seen in stroke or overlying structural lesion like a subdural hemorrhage causing decreased attenuation.

They are quite rare, but some are associated with background slowing.   Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Rare right anterior temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG captures only wakefulness and drowsiness.  The sharp waves identified above have morphology that suggests that they are not
normal variants.  If further information is needed, a followup study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin 1 gram, Ativan 12 mg, as well as added Ativan afterward; later intubated and placed on propofol.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term EEG for 18 hours was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional EKG and anterior temporal electrodes.  The patient was comatose and unresponsive during the EEG.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffuse background which is disorganized, mainly in the delta/theta frequencies with no normal posterior dominant rhythm and no normal frontocentral beta.  No normal sleep architecture is also seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges seen at T4-T6 at a frequency of 2 Hz with amplitude of 20 to 75 microvolts.  These discharges are seen continuously but appear to evolve as described in the seizure paragraph.  During the recording, these PLEDs become more blunted and less frequent, but they are continuously seen.  At times during the last part of the recording, they appeared to have more anterior predominance, moving from T4 forward to the F8 region.
Diffuse slow waves seen in the recording.
SEIZURES:   Frequent seizures are seen emanating from the T6-T4 electrode which evolve from PLEDs and stop.  There is a contralateral left hemisphere artifact as well as in the video left arm trembling can be seen during these seizures.  There are multiple of these occurring at the beginning of the recording, almost continuously. However, as the over time the recording improves, the periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges become more blunted and the seizures stop.  During the rest of the EEG, the last 10 hours of the EEG, there is only intermittent muscle artifact on the left hemisphere but no clear actual seizures being seen.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Frequent seizures arising from the left posterotemporal region, which later improve, and none seen during the last 10 hours.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization epilepsy arising from the right posterotemporal region, with multiple seizures seen from that region.  Please note that the seizures improve and none are seen during the last 10 hours. In addition there is continuous evidence of acute focal dysfunction and irritability in the right hemisphere.  Lastly, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which in this patient is likely due, at least in part, to medication affect.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat poorly organized.  There is a scant, 10-Hz alpha rhythm.  The major abnormalities in this record include left anterotemporal sharp waves.  These can be reviewed with an average reference and may be maximum at T1, F7, or occasionally FP1.  They are accentuated by hyperventilation and drowsiness.  There is rare, hypersynchronous bilateral theta and one or two bursts of focal, right central temporal slowing.

INTRODUCTION:  Long term digital video EEG was performed for 14 hours using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with a 1 channel EKG and anterior temporal electrodes.  The study was recorded while the patient was comatose.  No activity procedures were performed.  Continuous EEG monitoring was performed and reviewed using spike detection and seizure detection software as well as nursing noted events.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a low amplitude diffusely slow background with frequencies mainly in the delta range.  No normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta is seen.  No sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized periodic epileptiform discharges (GPEDs) were seen with anterior central maximum at a frequency of 1-2 Hz.  At times this would evolve, see description of seizures below.
Generalized slow waves seen at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  There are multiple seizures occurring per hour seen at the beginning of the recording which originate from GPEDs which increase in frequency and amplitude in seconds and later are obscured by a rhythmic intermittent muscle artifact.  The longest of these last about 40 seconds and afterwards  the background returns to baseline.  These seizures appear to subside 4 hours into the recording and after 10:30 at night no more are seen.  After this time the GPEDs appear to become slightly blunted and lower in amplitude, although at times intermittently the morphology changes to more sharply contoured but never clearly evolve into seizures.  Later in the recording in the morning hours there is some intermittent diffuse muscle artifact but no underlying evolution of seizures or epileptiform activity could be clearly seen in between the bursts of muscle.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized seizures.
Diffuse slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals multiple seizures with a generalized onset and interictal evidence of diffuse brain dysfunction and irritability.  These findings are consistent with a diffuse cortical injury and with a history of hypoxic injury.  The EEG appears to improve with time and during the last 10 hours of the recording no seizures can be clearly seen.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is in isolation.  This is an awake and sleep record in an ill-appearing, somewhat agitated patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is low to medium amplitude with a theta and beta pattern.  The right hemisphere demonstrates lower voltage beta.  The left hemisphere demonstrates more theta.  There is a medium amplitude, somewhat subtle, sharp wave noted in the left anterior temporal region.  It has little bit in variability, may be seen at T1, at 7 or even T3.  There is sometimes some posterior temporal spread to it.  The sharp waves may be seen with a subtle build-up of activity and at 11:48:56, while the patient is resting comfortably with no clinical signs, there is a build-up of theta with sharp activity.  The nurses are in the room and in fact, are standing in front of the patient and working with the patient.  He is interacting during this discharge and then another discharge is noted at 11:50:16.  This is followed by higher amplitude, left anterior temporal spike and slow wave complexes.  These demonstrate a P3 maximum.  A third more subtle discharge is noted at 11:56 but does not have the same build-up.  No clinical symptoms are associated with this.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The bursts described above are unclear significance.  While they are worrisome in terms of prominent, irritative epileptiform pattern, they are not remarkably evolving and there were no clinical seizures noted.  This may represent an inner ictal pattern for this individual with complex partial epilepsy.  Comparison with previous EEGs may be of value

Continuous spike and seizure detection software was used to review the EEG as well as noted patient event and nurses' reports.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact and electrode artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that, at best, reaches 6 Hz, which appears to sometimes be reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta seen .  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and some stage changes with sleep are seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen frequently at F7/T1 frequently.
Focal slow waves are seen at F7/T1 almost continuously throughout the recording at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  Throughout the recording, there appear to be intermittent episodes where the focal sharp waves at F7/T1 become rhythmic and increase in amplitude and evolving frequency for minutes.
During the recording there does not appear to be a clear correlate to these episodes, although at times appears to be some chewing artifact.  It is likely that these are multiple electrographic seizures occurring frequently throughout the recording.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Multiple frequent left anterior temporal electrographic seizures and sharp waves.
Focal slow waves in the left anterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals multiple frequent electrographic seizures arising from the left anterior temporal region with additional evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction and irritability in that same region.  These findings were communicated to the team.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm identified bilaterally.  There is a breach rhythm noted in the central region, more so on the left than on the right and there is a slight degree of focal slowing in the left central temporal region.
Hyperventilation accentuates focal slowing from the left hemisphere particularly frontal central - central temporal.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex phase K complexes and spindles.  The breach rhythm is more prominent during sleep.  There is also some more sharply quadrant slowing emerging at P3.  Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting off to sleep and does not clearly activate the record.  In the sleep record, the area of sharply quadrant slowing can include C3 and/or P3.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing from the left hemisphere which may be left central parietal in sleep and a little bit more central temporal and anterior temporal in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were no sharp waves or spikes noted, although there was some sharply contoured slowing. A 1-hour EEG was requested to try and capture one of this patient's spells, but was not performed.  A follow-up study was requested in an attempt to capture one of her episodes with the arm flutter.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a relatively fast alpha rhythm with alpha squeak noted with alpha rhythm transitioning to 13 Hz. In the transition in and out of sleep, there is rhythmic theta which is more prominent in the left temporal region. It has a 4 Hz component more than a 5 Hz component and then on some occasions, has a mixture of delta noted. Hyperventilation accentuates left temporal mixed beta delta with a T1 sharp wave noted infrequently during hyperventilation. This is also a finding that re-emerges in drowsiness. Photic stimulation is performed as the patient is drifting off to sleep. There is a photic driving response identified bilaterally.

MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a symmetric reactive 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. In relaxed wakefulness, there are bursts of frontally predominant 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity. Most bursts are under a second and all discharges are under 2 seconds in relaxed wakefulness. Hyperventilation clearly accentuates the frontally predominant spike and wave and poly spike and wave activity. The major of discharges are symmetric in the frontocentral region. Hyperventilation also produces an increase in burst duration with some bursts waxing and waning, but lasting up to 6 seconds in duration. In addition, there are more clearly developed frontally predominant spike and wave and even polyspike and wave complexes noted following hyperventilation.
The technologist tests the patient and does not identify clinical correlates with these bursts. There are a handful of eye movements sometimes seen around the bursts, but no definitive focal features. As the patient transitions in and out of drowsiness, the frontally predominant spike and wave discharges become higher amplitude. Sleep is not sustained. Photic stimulation also does seem to accentuate the discharges, but there are no discharges that outlast the photic stimulation.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Frontally predominant spike and wave complexes of 3.5 to 5 Hz.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No clinical seizures were recorded. These EEG characteristics are highly suggestive of a generalized or inherited mechanism for epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a well-organized pattern on the left with an alpha rhythm of 10 Hz.  On the right, the alpha rhythm is sometimes disrupted.  In the right posterior region, there is a mixture of 2.5 and 4 Hz beta activity.  This is most prominent on the right but is really seen throughout the right central temporal and frontotemporal regions.  Discrete sharp waves and spikes are noted in the right hemisphere.  They have some variability and may be O2 maximum, T6 maximum, or they may start at O2 and transition to T4.  They may occur as couplets.  Drowsiness seems to accentuate the epileptiform activity in the right occipital region.  Hyperventilation also seemed to accentuate both the focal slowing and sharp waves.  Other features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient has clinical seizures characterized by facial twitching and involuntary movements of the right arm.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins the patient has been having seizures and continues to have seizures.  The overall EEG is sharply contoured, almost a chaotic pattern, and intermittently discontinuous.  Left frontal sharp waves precede the seizure and the seizure includes a mixture of frontal and left hemispheric sharp activity and fast activity.  The activity is maximum in the front, but is really seen throughout the left hemisphere in the parasagittal region.  The fast activity is prominent in the central regions.  Some of the activity spreads to the right.
By 8:15 p.m. the epileptiform activity is a bit more isolated.  At 8:00 p.m. the patient receives a Dilantin load.  He develops respiratory distress and a pleural effusion.  He is placed on a propofol drip for respiratory management. No additional clinical seizures are observed.  The EEG demonstrates a pattern with left frontal or bifrontal sharp activity or fast activity with a discontinuous background.
HR:    104 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Initially status epilepticus pattern with repetitive seizures, improving to a discontinuous pattern with the use of both Dilantin and propofol.
INTERVAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG remains a highly epileptiform pattern.  There are bursts of sharp waves and spikes, but no clearly evolving seizures or clinical events noted in the later sections of the record.
LONG TERM MONITORING
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated, extremely ill, but responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a left frontal spike or a sharp wave, which is periodic, merging to nearly continuous.  It does not evolve, as would be expected with a seizure.  The remaining background is markedly slow and suppressed.
Despite the patient's arousability, with occasional spontaneous movement and reactivity to external stimuli, the background does not improve.  It is a markedly slow and suppressed pattern with a frontal PLED with a periodicity of approximately 1 to 2 per second.
HR:    100 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Markedly suppressed background.
Left frontal PLED with a generous field of spread.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  There are brief sections of the record where it is reasonably well organized with a 6.8 Hz alpha rhythm of 30 mV and a theta frequency background.  More commonly, there is frontally predominant mixed theta delta.  High amplitude or medium amplitude spike and slow wave and sharp and slow wave complexes are observed with many different localizations.  The majority of these are frontal, particularly FP2, but some are FP1, others F8, F7.  Some have a more temporal spread and others are maximum in the central or central parietal regions independently on the right or the left.  The epileptiform activity is focal, but is occasional bifrontal and generalized.
Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing.  The epileptiform activity may occur in pairs, but the two pairs are not always identical epileptiform discharges, although they are usually similar in terms of both occurring on the same hemisphere.  There may be a bit more focal slowing on the right as the patient transitions to sleep. Photic stimulation is remarkable for frequent epileptiform discharges with frontal delta, some of which almost has a spike and wave component on the left, but given the abundance of epileptiform activity, it is not clear that photic stimulation activated the record.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Multifocal epileptiform activity with prominent activity in the right frontal region.
Spike and wave activity seen with photic stimulation, perhaps more on the left.
Background slowing.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due:
Focal sharp and slow waves arising from the right frontocentral region.
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures arising rightly from the right frontocentral region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction in this region which has a direct correlation with a lesion in that region.  Lastly, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology, but may be due at least in part to medication effect.  No seizures were clearly seen.

REASON FOR EEG:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed  in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with an asymmetry in the frontal central beta seen more on the right.  There is no normal posterior dominant rhythm of 8 Hz to 9 Hz is seen over the left hemisphere.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves and slowing are seen at T4/F8 continuously throughout the recording with associated breech.
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz are seen throughout the recording.  In addition, there is increased diffuse beta seen at times.
SEIZURES:  At times during the recording the frontal sharp waves which appear to become more rhythmic in a pattern of 1-3 Hz and at times evolve to faster frequencies and then stop and start.  This is most consistent with small electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right anterior temporal sharp waves and slow waves.
Intermittent electrographic procedures in the setting of a breech.
Diffuse slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy, with electrographic seizures arising from the right anterior temporal region.  There is also evidence of focal structural dysfunction and irritability, which is
consistent with a known tumor.  These findings were communicated to the team as soon as the EEG was performed.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is awake.  Seizures are noted during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing opens, the patient is awake.  The EEG activity from the left hemisphere is, in fact, quite normal with a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  An alpha rhythm is also identified on the right, but there is a breach rhythm, medium to higher amplitude, arrhythmic delta activity and a sharp wave which is seen out of the breach rhythm, which may be maximum at T2 or T4.  There is also some periodic slowing noted.
The patient's first seizure occurs at 10:29:21, 6 minutes into the EEG.  She starts to pick or fuss with her covers.  She looks to the left.  She is a little bit interactive with the tech and the tech asks her to count to 10, but by the time the tech is asking her to count to 10, the seizure is over.  Total seizure duration is about 20 seconds.  Characteristics of this seizure include rhythmic, repetitive right temporal theta frequency activity and some postictal slowing.  Eye movement artifact is also prominently picked up in the temporal electrodes.
At the close of the record, as the nurse is working with the patient, an additional burst of the prominent arrhythmic delta activity is noted on the right.  The patient is awake and it is not clear that this event was considered clinically significant.
HR:    120 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
A brief, well-defined seizure out of the right temporal region.
Focal slowing in the right temporal region.
Another burst with prominent periodic delta also out of the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is diagnostic of a focal mechanism for epilepsy.  Previous EEGs demonstrated T6 seizures and PLEDs.  Today's seizures are a little bit more anterior.

INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while she was unresponsive or mildly responsive to stimulation.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with an intermixed overlying mainly frontal but diffusely appearing beta frequency rhythm.  This EEG does not reveal any normal posterior dominant rhythm or sleep architecture.  There are intermittent bursts of diffuse slowing where the beta dissipates but comes back at times.  The patient is stimulated and there appears to be no improvement in the frequencies of the EEG.

Generalized slow waves at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
Overlying diffuse beta rhythm that is not reactive to stimulation.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
Increased beta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regard to etiology; however, in this case the overlying beta seen throughout the recording is suggestive of medication-induced encephalopathy,
sometimes seen with benzodiazepines or barbiturates and at times with lithium.  No seizures were seen.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta.  It also accentuates subtle and well-defined left anterior temporal sharp waves with the maximum at F7, T1.  Following hyperventilation, there is some rhythmic repetitive 5 Hz activity but this is followed by an after-going slow wave.  In the transition to sleep, there is some shifting slowing.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  There is a great deal of muscle and movement artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This bedside recording is remarkable for an extraordinary amount of muscle artifact, more so on the right than the left.  This limits the ability to compare the two sides, but the background is abnormal from both sides.  In addition, there seems to be an asymmetry with a bit more focal slowing on the left and some left frontotemporal sharp waves.

Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
HR:    102 bpm and regular.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing characterized by intermittent disruption of faster frequency activity in the left frontotemporal region.
Generalized background slowing.
Underlying disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no epileptiform features.  While the pattern described above is nonspecific, the intermittent disruption of faster frequency activity is compatible with a structural process involving cortices might be seen following stroke.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a bedside EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm on the left.  The right hemisphere demonstrates significant disruption of faster frequency activity, particularly in the lateral temporal regions and central temporal regions.  Mu activity is identified on the left and at the midline, but not on the right.  As the recording continues there is variability of terms of the disruption of faster frequency activity on the right and in some sections the faster frequency is disrupted throughout the right hemisphere.  EKG artifact is prominent at T2.  This drowsy patient seems to have micro-sleeps with sleep spindles.
HR:    40-60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal due to:
Marked disruption of faster frequency activity in the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural or functional process on the right.  The micro-sleeps with stage II sleep may play a role in the somnolence.  The bradycardia may also merit a clinical evaluation.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term monitoring EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  Video recording was also performed.  Continuous spike detection software as well as seizure detection software along with the patient's alarms and nurses' notes were used to review the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient has a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  No activating procedures were performed.  The patient was recorded in stage I and stage II and deep slow-wave sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Only during sleep, some focal sharp waves were seen with a large field at FB2/F8 with small bursts seen rarely.
DAY 1:  Two events occurred during the first day of recording.  One occurred at 1:48 p.m. and the other one occurred at 11:07 p.m.  During both of them, the patient suddenly stated that she did not feel well and suddenly started having right arm shaking and moving side to side with her eyes closed with irregular body motions and hand shaking.  During the first event, she would also lift her legs and move side to side while unresponsive.  This lasted about 2 to 3 minutes, then stopped and the patient was back to herself.  The second one was of similar clinical presentation; however, the flapping and shifting side to side was much more aggressive and severe.  This lasted about 3 minutes.  During both events, the EEG appeared to remain normal with no epileptiform activity or EEG correlate to these events.
LONG TERM MONITORING – 12-57 – 05/09/2012 TO 05/10/2012
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Day 2:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm which reaches 9 Hz with a normal frontal central beta.  This patient is recorded in stage I, stage II, stage III, and REM sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  During sleep, specifically stage II to III, the patient appears to have some frequent bifrontal sharp waves at FP2, as well as some more temporal sharp waves.  There is also bursts of slowing with sharply contoured activity seen with multifocal regions more frontal more temporal, but not clear if it is epileptic.
No events were captured during this 24-hour recording.
SEIZURES:  None
This is long-term, day #3, 05/09/2012 to 05/10/2012, a total of 24 hour
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Day #3.
Abnormal discharges:  As stated above, focal sharp waves seen intermittently in sleep with abrupt at times more prominent in the right frontal region at FP-2 and sometimes F4, and quickly moving toward the right temporal lobe.  At times there are sharp waves that appear to be left frontal, FP3, and sometimes they appear to be more at T6 P3.  These are at times all seen in complexes that last for 1 to 2 seconds, usually mainly in sleep.
SEIZURES:
Complex partial seizure #1.  occurred on 05/09/2012 at 12:31 p.m. and ended at 12:34 p.m., with a total duration of 2 minutes and 14 seconds.  Description of seizure:  The patient is laying on her left side while asleep.  Suddenly she arouses, opens her eyes, and jolts her body, then her right arm moves up and becomes tonic while her left hand becomes dystonic in a spooning fashion.  The right arm then continues to lower down and stretches forward along with the left arm while her eyes go back and her moans.  She then starts having clonic jerks of both arms and body.  The lower extremities cannot be visualized clearly in the video.  She continues to have clonic jerks while moaning and then slowly the jerks start decreasing in frequency and then they stop with the last ictal jerk on the left hand.  Afterward, she lays in bed unresponsive.  She is not tested during the entire seizure.
EEG during seizure #1:  At onset, there is a generalized attenuation of faster frequencies followed by a generalized polyspike discharge that appears to be slightly more predominant over the right hemisphere than the left with no clear area of maximality, which in about 20 seconds appears to settle on the right temporal lobe more than the left and continues to evolve in frequency and then spread to the frontal region of the right hemisphere and then seen later spreading through the frontal lobe of the left hemisphere and then generalizing and obscured by muscle artifact.  At the end of the seizure there appears to be diffuse attenuation.
Tonic-clonic seizure #2 occurred at 4:00 in the morning and ended at 4:02 in the morning.  Seizure description:  The patient again is asleep, this time laying on her right side.  The patient opens her eyes about 8 seconds into the electrographic seizure but does not move until about 30 seconds after the electrographic seizure begins.  Suddenly both hands become dystonic and stiff while stretching forward slightly, and she remains tonic with tonic stress posturing for about 20 to 30 seconds.  Afterward she starts having tonic-clonic movements of both arms while moaning repeatedly.  She continues to do this until the jerks, after increasing frequency, start decreasing in frequency and then later stop.
EEG description:  Again, at the onset of the seizure, there appears to be a slight diffuse attenuation and slowing with no clear onset but appears to have a slight right-sided predominance, although it is mainly generalized with polyspikes that appear to be somewhat temporal and frontal maximal.  As the seizure evolves in frequency, it appears to settle slightly over the right temporal lobe, then spreading quickly to the prefrontal region bilaterally and then is obscured by muscle artifact.  At the end of the seizure, there is diffuse attenuation seen.
SEIZURES #3:  Occurred at 06:13 in the morning and ended at 6:15 in the morning.  Seizure description:  The patient is again asleep and opens her eyes about 8 seconds into the seizure, but lays there still and about 20 seconds later her eyes rolled up and her both arms lift up in the air in a dystonic fashion, the right slightly more than the left, followed by stretching forward and both hands becoming dystonic, and then clonic movements increasing in frequency and then decreasing in frequency with associated grunting.  At the end, the last ictal jerk is seen on the left.  No testing was performed during this seizure, either.
EEG description:  At the onset of the seizure, again there is a diffuse slowing with a sharp wave seen, appears to be slightly maximal at T6, followed by polyspikes that appear to be more posterior than anterior and maximal maybe under the right posterotemporal region at T6 which appeared to evolve and settle mainly over T4, followed by a frontal spread and then generalized spreading and obscuration by muscle artifact.  Again, at the end of the seizure, there is diffuse slowing seen.
Day #4:
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  As previous days
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  The impression is abnormal EEG due to multifocal spikes from both hemispheres, at times with right predominance but seen in both hemispheres, as well as 3 seizures with unclear onset which appear to be generalized, at times with a right frontal slight predominance.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This long-term video monitoring unit is diagnostic of what appears to be multifocal localization related epilepsy with seizures possibly arising from the frontal and temporal regions.  In addition, the events during day 1 of recording had no EEG correlate.  As such, these events are not epileptic and are diagnostic psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This long-term video monitoring unit is diagnostic of what appears to be multifocal localization related epilepsy with seizures possibly arising from the frontal and temporal regions.  In addition, the events during day 1 of recording had no EEG correlate.  As such, these events are not epileptic and are diagnostic psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.

EKG artifact is picked up in the right temporal region and there are some subtle, broadly contoured right temporal sharp waves. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.  In addition, around the time of photic stimulation, there are some discrete bifrontal sharp waves not clearly elicited by photic stimulation.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background disorganization.
Intermittent, paroxysmal bursts of rhythmic slowing.
Left anterior temporal sharp waves.
Suspicious underlying bifrontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Previous EEGs were not available for comparison.  Although there are left temporal spikes, the overall pattern raises concerns about a more complex epilepsy then temporal lobe epilepsy syndrome.

MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Simvastatin, Zosyn, Vancomycin, Flagyl, Solu Medrol
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is intubated and comatose.  The technologist observes that the patient has intermittent eye movements.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates primarily a burst suppression pattern with a markedly suppressed pattern.  In the bursts of activity that occur, there are bursts of high amplitude, sharply contoured faster frequency activity.  Some of these bursts begin on the left.  The duration of the bursts varies from 3 seconds to 10-15 seconds.  Many of the bursts, particularly those with high amplitude activity, are associated with eye blink.  At the beginning of a burst there are typically three eye blinks.  In addition, in some of the discharges when the patient has another high voltage burst within that burst, eye blink will be seen again. Later sections of the record demonstrate a burst and attenuation pattern with lower voltage theta, but the initial sections are markedly suppressed.
HR:    120 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Burst suppression pattern.
What appears to be an ictal pattern with consistent pattern of eye blinking with high voltage discharges.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a very worrisome pattern, 18 hours following cardiac arrest.  Because of the correlation between the discharges on the EEG and the patient's clinical symptoms, this EEG should be considered ictal.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated and somnolent.  Stimulation of the patient was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is diffusely slow with a lower voltage, rhythmic 7 Hz theta pattern and smaller amounts of delta.  Stimulation of the patient produces beta spindles on some occasions and on other occasions produces an arousal with both muscle of faster frequency activity.  There are shifting asymmetries observed.  On some occasions the left appears to be slower than the right but there is also a asymmetry in the degree of muscle artifact.  Stimulation of the patient produces eye opening and movement artifact.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The background slowing is a nonspecific finding and may be due to medications, toxic or metabolic factors or even post ictal state.  Asymmetries in this record may have been masked by the amount of muscle artifact.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Lamictal, Dopamine, Dobutamine, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement.  The patient is poorly responsive and has a tracheostomy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  Multiple electrographic seizures are noted with high amplitude epileptiform activity from the left hemisphere, typically maximum in the left frontal central region, but with a generous field of spread.
The spikes seems to be maximum at C3, but fast activity is seen throughout the left frontal central region with more periodic activity left frontal.  In some locations there seems to be a posterior to anterior lag or even more than one epileptiform focus in the left temporal region, but the ictal driver seems to be in the left frontal central region.
Seizures are typically on the duration of 1-2 minutes.  Characteristic frequency of evolution of the seizures was observed.
Despite the marked background slowing, the patient seems to be somewhat responsive.  During the seizures, he has head turning to the right, but not really a forced deviation, more of a more gentle head turning.
When he is not seizing, he does seem to demonstrate some head control and some spontaneous movement on the left when the seizures stop.
The background EEG is otherwise markedly slow bilaterally.
HR:    120 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
A status epilepticus pattern with multiple, repetitive seizures from the left hemisphere.
Sharp waves and spikes in the left.
Intermittent burst suppressed pattern when the patient is not seizing.
Some generalized periodic complexes observed in the interictal section of the record.
Some posterior predominant generalized periodic discharges also noted in the interictal period.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient has previously been evaluated for status epilepticus out of the left hemisphere.  This EEG may demonstrate some features which are due to anoxic encephalopathy, as well as the ictal pattern.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there was a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  This is a clearly focal EEG with focal slowing in the left hemisphere, maximum in the mid-to-posterior temporal region.  There are simple T5 and T3 sharp waves noted in the background.  There are occasional spikes which are left anterior temporal followed by a T2 more subtle spike.  Hyperventilation accentuates the focal slowing with more rhythmic theta-delta in the left frontotemporal region and attenuation of faster frequency activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  The alpha drops our earlier on the left than the right.  Other features of drowsiness include a transition to more left mid-to-posterior temporal focal slowing and sharp waves. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving on the right.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left temporal focal slowing, often posterior temporal.
Sharp waves in the left temporal region including anterior temple or posterior temple, and sometimes with the field extending to T2.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to superior frequency amplitude gradient.  Large portions of the EEG consist of diffuse significant muscle artifact that obscures large portions of the EEG.  Visible underlying activity consists of a mixture of low amplitude polymorphic theta mixed with faster frequencies.

CONDITIONS OF RECORDING:  Digital video continuous EEG performed was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is a right to left interhemispheric asymmetry.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the left hemisphere consists of a low to moderate amplitude 9 to 10 Hz alpha activity with preserved anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the right hemisphere consists of 79 Hz activity with weak anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  During sleep, sleep spindles and at least epoch of REM sleep is captured.  There is additional continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity over the right hemisphere, most notably over the right temporal region.  Independent right anterior temporal frontocentral epileptiform discharges and additional independent right midtemporal as well as independent right posterior quadrant/occipital epileptiform discharges are captured.  Phase reversal occurs over F8, T6, and O2 electrodes, respectively.  As the recording progresses, frequency of right occipital/right posterior quadrant epileptiform discharges increases.  A single episode concerning for an electrographic seizure is captured.  It starts at about 10:45 p.m., lasting until about 10:50 p.m.  It is characterized by rhythmic slow delta activity observed over the right hemisphere, most notably over the right temple region with embedded sharp waves over T6 and O2 electrodes.  The patient appears to wake up at the beginning of the seizure.  Also, there is an increase in the heart rate observed in a single EKG lead from about 120 beats a minute to about 130 to 140 beats a minute.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
FINDINGS:
Focal slowing over the right hemisphere, most notably over the right temple region.
Independent epileptiform discharges over the right anterior temporal central region, right midtemporal region, and right posterior quadrant/occipital region.  The frequency of these epileptiform discharges increases as the recording progresses.
Likely a single electrographic right hemispheric, primarily right midtemporal/right posterior quadrant electrographic seizure is captured at approximately 10:45 p.m.  This seizure lasted approximately 5 minutes.  There is an associated increase in the heart rate during the event, as well as the patient awakening at the beginning of the event.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal continuous, about 15 hour, video EEG due to:
Continuous moderate right hemispheric slowing, most notable over the right midtemporal region.
Independent right anterior frontocentral, right midtemporal, and right posterior quadrant/occipital region epileptiform discharges.
Likely a single approximately 5-minute focal right hemispheric, primarily right midtemporal/right posterior quadrant electrographic seizure.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   These findings indicate a significant dysfunction over the right hemisphere, likely structural in etiology with increased epileptogenic potential.  These findings were conveyed to the Neurology consulting team at the time of the review.

In that same area there is an increase of larger amplitude and faster frequencies seen bilaterally consistent with a breech rhythm.  At times there is some sharply contoured wave forms in this region, but not clearly epileptiform.  However, the limited quality of the EEG due to the muscle artifact sometimes obscures clear identification of these waves forms.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Independent bilateral temporal continuous slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction in both mid temporal regions, which is consistent with the known trauma  and hemorrhage.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
This patient had a previous EEG on April 19, 2012 which showed focal slow waves at T4/C4 and some generalized slowing, which is slightly different than the EEG today.  A previous EEG on March 22, 2012 had shown generalized slowing and some more slowing on the left hemisphere than the right.

MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was completed using  standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The awake EEG is abnormal.  There is an asymmetry.  The alpha rhythm in the left hemisphere is slow at 7.5 Hz.  In contrast, the right hemisphere demonstrates little in the way of alpha activity.  The right hemisphere demonstrates globally, slower activity with a mixture of theta and smaller amounts of delta.  The left hemisphere also has a slow alpha rhythm and a bit of background theta.  Occasional bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta are noted from the left or right hemisphere.  As the patient becomes drowsy, the EEG becomes a little bit more rhythmic and the asymmetry on the right is a bit more apparent.  The focal slowing from the right hemisphere may be seen in the frontotemporal or the centroparietal regions.  In this sharply contoured background, there are subtle, right frontal sharp waves noted.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.  Heart rate 64 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
An asymmetry with more significant focal slowing on the right.
Mild disorganization on the left.
Shifting slowing.
In the sharply contoured background, rare subtle right frontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the right, but a bihemispheric process may be considered (ischemic cerebrovascular disease).  The subtle sharp waves raise the possibility of a focal mechanism for seizures.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some electrode artifact, mainly over the left hemisphere, seen continuously.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 to 10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal sharp waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 during wakefulness and drowsiness, as well as F8/T4, also during wakefulness and drowsiness (slightly more on the left than the right).

Diffuse slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific cerebral dysfunction that in his case could partially be related to toxic metabolic etiology.  Triphasic waves are observed in different forms of encephalopathy.  Focal left frontocentral slowing could be secondary to an underlying cerebral dysfunction that is structural in etiology and is consistent with the patient's history of left frontal craniotomy.

There is prominent disruption of faster frequency activity in the right hemisphere with a periodic complex in the right hemisphere with variability, typically right occipital, but sometimes maximum T6 or P4.  No clinical seizures were observed, but the periodic activity waxes and wanes and, in fact, when the patient is a bit more active with muscle artifact there is clearly more theta in the right hemisphere.

There is right to left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms at lower amplitudes over the left hemisphere.  The background consists of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude, mixture of theta and delta activity and abundant triphasic wave forms while the patient is awake.  By the end of the recording, the patient appears asleep; however, no normal sleep architecture is captured.  There are no clear epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Focal left hemispheric slowing and voltage attenuation.
Abundant triphasic wave forms.
No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 2-hour continuous video EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing, focal left hemispheric slowing at lower voltages, and abundant triphasic wave forms.  These findings indicate nonspecific cerebral dysfunction that is moderate in degree and at least partially related to toxic metabolic disturbances.  Focal slowing an attenuation over the left hemisphere indicates left hemispheric dysfunction that could be structural in etiology.  Triphasic wave forms are seen in nonspecific encephalopathy.  There were no clear electrographic seizures.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 51-year-old woman with past medical history of metastatic breast cancer, with right parietal lobe resection of the metastasis performed several months ago, now presents with several days of a significant decline in her mental status.  Continuous EEG is performed to rule out subclinical seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Video was enabled.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  During arousal, the background consists of a mixture of polymorphic low-to-moderate amplitude theta, delta, and abundant triphasic waveforms.  These triphasic waveforms have an anterior-to-posterior lag.  They are frontally predominant, and more predominant over the right hemisphere.  During brief periods of sleep, no normal sleep architecture is present, and there are occasional periods of brief discontinuity lasting approximately 1 second.  Additionally, polymorphic delta activity at lower voltages is captured over the left hemisphere.  There were no clear electrographic seizures.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Focal left hemispheric slowing and attenuation.
Abundant triphasic waveforms.
No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal continuous video EEG, lasting approximately 14-1/2 hours.  The EEG is abnormal due to moderate diffuse slowing, focal left hemispheric slowing and attenuation and abundant triphasic waveforms that are more prominent over the right hemisphere.  These findings indicate moderate cerebral dysfunction that is nonspecific in etiology, but could partially be related to toxic metabolic causes.  Focal slowing and attenuation over the left hemisphere could indicate a structural lesion over that region.  Additionally, discrepancies in the degree of slowing and amplitudes could also be related to a breach artifact present over the right hemisphere.  Triphasic waveforms indicate nonspecific encephalopathy.  No clear electrographic seizures are captured.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some frontal muscle artifact on the right.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8-8.5 Hz intermittently which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta seen best over the left hemisphere.
Photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
The patient appears to be in stage I sleep at one point in the recording.
Heart rate 84.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen continuously at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Focal slow waves seen intermittently over F7/T3.  These are seen at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts, again seen intermittently.
Mild excessive theta in wakefulness at a frequency of 5-7 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen throughout the recording in limited wakefulness.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to continuous right frontal slowing in addition to intermittent left anterior temporal slowing and mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral structural dysfunction in the right frontal region including almost the entire right hemisphere, which is consistent with a known intracerebral hemorrhage.  In addition, there is some left anterior temporal focal slowing as well as some mild generalized slowing, both of which are nonspecific in regards etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.

MEDICATIONS:  The patient's medications include Dilantin, nortriptyline, aspirin, lisinopril, Tricor, and fluoxetine.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the lab using a standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to one channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation are performed to see tracing captures wakefulness only.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was asymmetric and characterized by 9-10 Hz in frequency, 30-40 microvolts in amplitude seen in the left occipital region and 8-8.5 Hz on the right side which attenuated with eye opening.  There was right hemispheric slowing in theta frequency and attenuation with loss of faster frequencies noted throughout the study. There were intermittent focal slowing in the left frontal and anterior temporal regions consisting of 5-6 Hz theta frequency activity with 30-40 microvolt amplitude lasting for 1-2 seconds, occasionally with a field to the left anterior and mid temporal region.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple/frequencies and result in no driving response. No epileptiform activity with seizures were seen in the study.  Heart rate was 90-100 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing wakefulness only due to:
Right hemispheric attenuation and slowing with loss of faster frequencies.
Intermittent left frontotemporal slowing during wakefulness.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Diffuse attenuation and loss of faster frequencies in the right hemispheric could be seen in the structural lesions of the underlying cerebral cortex or fluid accumulation in the extra-axial space.  Right hemispheric slowing is suggestive of subcortical structure or functional abnormalities. Focal left frontal and temporal slowing could be suggestive of an underlying structural abnormality in the left hemisphere or left frontotemporal dysfunction.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No epileptiform abnormalities were seen in this record. This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using the standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. This tracing captures the patient in a confused and obtunded state.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the confused, obtunded state, there is diffuse slowing of the background consisting of 5-6 Hz theta frequency activity intermixed with 2-3 Hz delta activity.  He had 10-20 microvolts in amplitude.  There were also triphasic waves seen occasionally with a frequency of 1 to 1.5 Hz, occasionally posteriorly predominant.

The presence of triphasic waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Diffuse slowing and triphasic waves are suggestive of either metabolic toxic, anoxic or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction.  The triphasic waves could also be due to the patient's underlying liver disease.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record.  No seizures were captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while minimally responsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 6 to 7 Hz, which appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the right frontal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right hemisphere, maximal in the anterior temporal region, which is likely due to the known mass and lesion.  Lastly, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures were seen.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was quite drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a breach rhythm with considerably higher amplitude activity on the left compared to the right.  As the EEG begins, the patient is asleep with generous beta of 13 Hz in the frontocentral region, but without some of the typical features of stage II sleep.  The activity on the right is lower voltage and slow.  With stimulation, there is some sharply contoured activity appearing at T5 and T1.  Higher amplitude focal delta is noted throughout the left hemisphere and varies from left frontocentral to mid to posterior temporal region.  As the patient becomes a bit sleepier, the activity on the right is lower voltage and slower.  In sleep, despite the breach rhythm, there is more of a left parietal focus.  Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
Heart rate 90 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing from the left hemisphere with variability, but in sleep much more prominent in the left parietal region.
Sharply contoured slowing in the context of a breach rhythm with suggestion of a left parietal sharp wave.
Some sharp wave contoured wave forms in the left frontocentral or frontotemporal region, as well.
In wakefulness, the background is also slow on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural or functional abnormality on the left, congruent with a previous tumor and surgical history.  The foci of sharply contoured slowing is more prominent in the left parietal region in sleep, but is a little bit more anteriorly when the patient is stimulated.  The bilateral background slowing may be due to a diffuse brain process or postictal state.

INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20  system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.   Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated moderate amplitude 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Intermittent brief drowsiness is captured and is characterized by increase in the amount of diffuse theta activity. Intermittent polymorphic theta activity is captured over the right frontal temporal central region.  Additional faster frequencies are captured over the right frontal central region.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and intermittently drowsy EEG due to intermittent mild right frontal temporal central slowing.  This finding indicates etiologically nonspecific focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, and is consistent with patient's history of right craniotomy.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is quite slow, with a mixture of theta and delta.  Superimposed upon this are bursts of sharply contoured slowing and occasional sharp waves or sharply contoured delta maximum at T1 or T3.  As the recording continues, the patient starts to wake up a bit spontaneously with the appearance of alpha frequency activity in the background, right greater than left, and a posterior dominant rhythm of 8 Hz on the right, a bit disrupted on the left.  When unstimulated the patient starts to transition into a sleep pattern but overall, as the recording continues, the overall background is improving and the patient starts to transition to more of a stage 1, stage 2 sleep pattern.
At the end of the record, the patient is talking, there is an increase in alpha and theta frequency activity, although the patient is confused.
Heart rate 116 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal but dynamic record due to:
Bilateral, significant background slowing noted early in the record which improved over time.

Sharp waves seen at T3 and T1.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the fifth EEG for this patient.  It is better organized at the end of record than previous studies.  No seizures were recorded.  And the epileptiform activity and the background slowing are significantly less prominent than in some previous studies.  The best fit for this EEG is a postictal pattern in a patient who is improving.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of recent left MCA distribution ischemic stroke, who is scheduled to undergo left CEA tomorrow on 01/03/2013.
MEDICATIONS:  Nystatin, Lovenox, and Protonix.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to a standard 10-20 system with a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is a significant right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower wave forms at higher amplitudes over the left hemisphere.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the right hemisphere reaches 9 to 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  Additionally, there is an anterior-to-posterior frequency MCA gradient observed over the right hemisphere.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the left hemisphere is very unstable and reaches maximum about 8 Hz and it does not appear to attenuate with eyes opening.  There is no AP gradient over the left hemisphere.  Additionally, there is continuous polymorphic theta and delta observed over the left hemisphere.  Occasionally brief bursts of diffuse frontally predominant rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) is captured.  This activity is higher in amplitude over the left hemisphere.  During drowsiness bursts of theta and delta activity seen over the right hemisphere and frequency of FIRDA increases.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation does not result in additional abnormalities.
FINDINGS:
Continuous moderate left hemispheric slowing.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 23-minute EEG due to continuous moderate left hemispheric slowing.  This finding indicates a focal left hemispheric dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, and in this patient is consistent with a history of recent left MCA territory infarct.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to single right mid temporal sharp waves in addition to continuous focal slow waves in the left anterior temporal region with some intermittent focal slowing in the right anterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures possibly arising from the right mid temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal structural dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region which is consistent with the known surgery and injury.
Lastly, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right anterior temporal region which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures were clearly seen.

CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consisted of a well formed and modulated moderate amplitude 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness, the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates but stage II sleep is not achieved.  Intermittent bursts of theta and delta activity are captured over the bitemporal regions.  Activity within these bursts is often sharply contoured; however, no clear sharp waves are observed within these bursts of slowing.  Additionally, there is significant EMG artifact during some parts of the recording and epileptic activity could have been missed as a result of this.

INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode with a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower wave forms observed over the left hemisphere.  The background consists of a mixture of diffuse beta, theta, and delta activity.  Additional polymorphic often sharply contoured delta is observed over the left hemisphere, primarily over the left temporal region.  Several electrographic seizures are captured in this recording.  Seizures have abrupt onset without clear localization or lateralization.  Electrographically diffuse EMG artifact is observed.  Once the EMG artifact resolves generalized sharply contoured approximately 3 Hz rhythmic delta activity is observed diffusely, but it is higher in amplitude over the left hemisphere.  This activity increases in amplitude and decreases in frequency to approximately 2 Hz and often evolves into another episode of generalized EMG artifact that obscures the recording.  Once that EMG artifact resolves, rhythmic sharply contoured 3-4 Hz delta activity is often observed over the left temple region.
Clinically it appears that the patient moans and slobbers at the onset of seizure and has decreased responsiveness during the seizure.
FINDINGS:
Focal status epilepticus.
Excess beta.
Left hemispheric slowing most pronounced over the left temporal region.
Mild to moderate diffuse slowing.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 26-minute electroencephalogram due to diffuse slowing, focal left hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the left temporal region and multiple focal left temporal electrographic seizures without returning back to baseline.  Diffuse background slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal left hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the temporal region indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, and in this case, could partially be to related post-ictal phenomenon.  Multiple electrographic and clinical seizures captured during the recording are consistent with focal status epilepticus.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Maximal wakefulness is achieved by the end of the recording.  During maximal wakefulness, the posterior dominant rhythm consists of 7 to 8 Hz theta activity.  The anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient is weak.  The majority of the recording is captured during sleep.  Abundant sleep spindles are captured.

Mild diffuse slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Asymmetry of sleep architecture could be secondary to underlying focal pathology, and in this case could be consistent with the patient's history of prior intracerebral hemorrhage and surgery.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 8.5 to 9 Hz performed in the right occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is hemispheric asymmetry, which is characterized by left hemispheric attenuation and slowing with loss of faster frequencies.  There is also almost continuous left temporal delta activity maximal at T3/T1 during this recording.  There are occasional sharp wave discharges noted at T3/C3/T5 with no evolution or electrographic seizures.  There is excess theta activity during wakefulness.  Stage I and stage II sleep were characterized by disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact, as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and posts and also K complexes and sleep spindles.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in an asymmetric driving response, most pronounced on the right side.  Heart rate was 60 and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to;
Left hemispheric asymmetry characterized by slowing, attenuation, and loss of faster frequencies.
Almost continuous left temporal delta activity, maximal at T3 and T1.
Occasional sharp wave discharges noted at C3/T3/T5.
Excess theta activity during wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Left hemispheric asymmetry characterized by loss of faster frequencies and attenuation could be due to a history of left MCA ischemic stroke.  Continuous left temporal delta activity in left temporal region could be due to structural abnormalities in the left temporal area or left temporal dysfunction.  The sharp wave discharges in left parietal, central, and temporal region are indicative of irritability of cerebral cortex in this area and place this patient at higher risk for partial seizures.  Diffuse excess theta activity is suggestive of toxic, metabolic, degenerative, infectious, or ischemic encephalopathy.  Clinical correlation is recommended.

MEDICATIONS:  Decadron, Depakote, many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was a drowsy individual.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is slow and disorganized.  There is an asymmetry noted.  There is a bit more faster frequency activity noted in the left hemisphere, particularly in the left frontal region compared to the right.  With stimulation, there is an alerting response and an 8 Hz alpha rhythm is identified bilaterally.  As the patient drifted in and out of sleep, there was shifting in delta activity but the activity is a bit slower on the right compared to the left.
Features of drowsiness included an increase in background slowing.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Shifting slowing with attenuation of some of the faster frequency activity on the right compared to the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The mass effect of this tumor may account for the mismatch in terms of the field of slowing in comparison to the MRI findings.  No epileptiform features were noted.  The bilateral background slowing suggests a diffuse process as may be seen in the context of increased intracranial pressure or mass effect.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This was a complicated EEG due to the patient's braided hair.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness there is 9 Hz of alpha rhythm with excess beta.  There is shifting slowing noted with a little bit of more rhythmic slowing in the right posterior quadrant.
In hyperventilation and relaxed wakefulness, isolated, frontally-predominant discrete spike and wave complexes are noted at 3-5 Hz.
Photic stimulation elicits a subtle driving response but no definitive spike in wave activity.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Excess beta.
Excess theta.
Occasional shifting slowing a bit more in the right posterior quadrant.
Frontally-predominant spike and wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The excess beta may be due to medications.  The excess theta may also be attributed to some of this patient's medications.  The focal features should be correlated with imaging and generalized spike and wave activity has been previously identified from this patient.

The patient admitted on the 27th, one day after seizure with persistent, right-sided weakness.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively alert, but had increasing right-sided weakness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient seems to be a bit drowsy.  In the drowsy state, there is a low voltage 8 Hz alpha rhythm on the right.  From the left hemisphere, continue with focal slowing was identified with arrhythmic delta, a breach rhythm with higher amplitude delta and sharply contoured slowing with variable maxima, T1, T3.  There was also focal delta picked up in the left centroparietal region.  The patient does maintain an awake state during the later portions of the record, but with somewhat disorganized pattern on the right and an alpha rhythm, which reaches only 8 Hz.  There was also some shifting and slowing noted from the right hemisphere, but with much more prominent arrhythmic delta activity from the left hemisphere.  Intermittent, frontally predominant bilateral deltas identified.  In the context of a breach rhythm, there is a single left frontal sharp and slow wave complex identified.
Photic stimulation did not significantly impact the record.
Heart rate 90 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to;
Continuous focal slowing from the left hemisphere with disruption of faster frequency activity.
Sharply contoured delta in the left with variable maximum including midtemporal or posterotemporal as well as centroparietal.
Mild slowing and disorganization on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports the structural or functional process on the left involving gray and white matter, and is congruent with previous brain tumor history and surgical resection.  There is a previous EEG performed in December after a seizure.  To compare these 2 records, the right hemisphere appears to be better organized today.  The left hemisphere is essentially unchanged, but these 2 EEGs may have been performed under somewhat different conditions.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 25-year-old man with history of a left cerebellar tumor resection status post chemo and radiation, and epilepsy secondary to the tumor, presents with recurrent seizures with right-sided shaking and confusion, as well as paralysis.



MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Tylenol, Lovenox, Dilantin and clindamycin.



INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake.  Activating procedures were not performed.



DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that can only be seen over the right hemisphere that reaches 8.5 Hz.  There is some frontocentral beta seen over the right hemisphere only.  The patient was recorded only in wakefulness.  Activating procedures were not performed.



HEART RATE:  74.



ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow wave seen continuously over the left hemisphere maximal at T3 at a frequency of 1-2 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  This is seen continuously throughout the recording.  At times, it becomes very monomorphic.  In addition, over the anterior electrodes, there appears to be an intermixed frontal very sharply contoured theta that appears in bursts of about 1 second, stops and starts again, occurring intermittently.



SEIZURES:  During the recording, the patient had seizures that began with his eyes turning to the right followed by a burst of head movement to the right, then his right arm became tonic and stretched tonically in front of him, followed by some dystonic posturing of the right hand and trembling while the left arm became flexed at the elbow in front of him making a sign of ""4"".  Afterward, the patient slowly developed clonic movements and the seizure slowly subsided as the clonic movements decreased in frequency and amplitude. Last ictal jerk was on the right arm.



EEG:  During this episode, the EEG at onset revealed the rhythmic left hemispheric slowing, but no clear onset could be ascertained for the seizure.  The seizure was quickly masked by muscle artifact and there appeared to be some prefrontal sharps in between the muscle artifact.  After the event, there appears to be focal remaining slowing over the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere appears to have almost normal theta to alpha rhythm.



IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures likely arising from the left frontal region, based on semiology and EEG, in addition to continuous focal slowing over the left hemisphere maximal in the mid temporal region.





CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy with seizures arising from the left hemisphere likely frontal region, in addition to revealing focal structural cerebral dysfunction from the left hemisphere maximal in the mid temporal region which is consistent with the known lesions.  These findings were reported to the primary team as they occurred.

MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, aspirin, Plavix, Keppra, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 7-8 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is 6-7 Hz diffuse theta activity seen during wakefulness, which is distributed symmetrically.  There is a small amount of low amplitude, frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm and slowing of the background and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  There were occasional burst of left anterior and mid temporal slowing at F7/T3, during wakefulness consisting of 4-5 Hz activity.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in no driving response.  Heart rate was 60 beats per minutes and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Diffuse slowing of the background with theta activity seen in wakefulness and slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
Left focal temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Diffuse slowing could be due to metabolic, toxic, hypoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of sedating medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  Focal slowing is suggestive of a structural abnormality in the left hemisphere or left temporal dysfunction.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.  If clinically indicated, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or continuous bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.

Seizure on February 23, with loss of consciousness, numbness of the hands and slurring speech and hyperactive eye movements.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Tylenol with codeine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Patient was relatively somnolent. Photic stimulation was completed. Hyperventilation was deferred.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat disorganized, but there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Occasional bursts of shifting slowing are noted in wakefulness and into drowsiness.  Broadly contoured vertex sharp waves were noted.  EKG artifact was a bit more prominent on the left, but there was also a very slight suggestion of a bit more focal slowing on the left compared to the right.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate 96 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Occasional burst of shifting slowing.
A very subtly symmetry with a bit more sharply contoured slowing in the left frontotemporal frontocentral region relative to the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive sharp waves were noted, although this EEG was remarkable for a fair amount of both EKG and eye movement artifact.  Additional EEG recording with more extensive sleep may be helpful to characterize epileptiform activity.  In this individual with a history of previous aneurysm, no cranial defect was noted by the tech and there was no definitive breech rhythm.

History of dementia, psychosis, autism, depression, hypothyroidism.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Klonopin, Gabapentin, Seroquel, and many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient is in a hard collar and isolation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates an asymmetry.  The activity from the right hemisphere includes a mixture of data with smaller amounts of delta in this awake patient.  There is abundant 6 Hz activity and a glimpse of an 8 Hz alpha rhythm. The activity is relatively attenuated on the left.  As the patient becomes drowsy, the right hemisphere transitions a bit more towards the delta pattern.  There is some sharp wave contoured theta noted in the right hemisphere, particularly at T2 and there was also some arrhythmic delta activity in the right posterior quadrant as the patient becomes drowsy.
Heart rate 96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
Intra-hemispheric asymmetry with relative attenuation of the activity on the left compared to the right.
Background slowing noted bilaterally, right greater than left.
There are some subtle sharp waves noted on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural or functional abnormality on the left and the attenuated pattern is relatively characteristic of a subdural hematoma.  The sharp waves noted are relatively subtle.  These findings should be correlated with imaging.  Overall, this electroencephalogram supports a bihemispheric process, impacting the left hemisphere more so than the right but a subdural hematoma can attenuate the EEG.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for seizure disorders, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, schizophrenia, ethanol abuse, head trauma.  Head CT showed right MCA stroke.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Serax, vancomycin, lisinopril, thiamine, folic acid, Norvasc.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 9 Hz seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is generalized low amplitude beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  There are almost continuous right frontotemporal slowing at times with loss of faster frequencies.  There is occasional independent left temporal slowing, most pronounced in mid and anterior temporal region lasting for 1 or 2 seconds with a frequency of 2 to 2.5 Hz.  Drowsiness was is characterized by disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm and slowing of the background and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  Heart rate was 80 to 90 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to,
Right hemispheric slowing with loss of faster frequencies.
Left temporal slowing.
There is no epileptiform activity or seizures noted during this recording.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Continuous right hemispheric slowing is consistent with an underlying structural abnormality, in this case right MCA stroke.  Left temporal slowing is consistent with left temporal dysfunction.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  Generalized beta activity could be due to medication effect including benzodiazepine or barbiturate, and also could be due to anxiety or hyperthyroidism.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were seen in this record.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or of intermittent seizures.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat sleep-deprived EEG or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm, but there is a small amount of 7 Hz theta activity identified in the background.  Hyperventilation is performed early in the record increasing the amplitude of the background and producing a small amount of theta.  Features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha rhythm, and increase in theta and slow rolling eye movements.  Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved.
Photic stimulation was remarkable for photo electric artifact.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This a mildly abnormal EEG due to:
Mild excess theta noted in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this EEG or in the previous EEG.  If epilepsy is an important consideration a follow-up test which may be a sleep-deprived EEG or a more prolonged sleep EEG may be helpful in capturing epileptiform activity.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and one channel of EKG.  Wakefulness and sleep were captured.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz frequency which is symmetric on both sides and reactive to eye opening.  There is a good anterior and posterior gradient.  There is some shifting slowing as the patient drifts into sleep.  Stage 2 sleep was achieved which was characterized by vertex waves, K complexes and spindles.  There was a wicket rhythm noted in stage 2 sleep.  As the recording progresses there are F7 sharp waves and rare T1 sharp waves which were identified as not being a part of the wicket rhythm.
Photic stimulation was performed which elicited a spiky driving response.
There was excessive theta in early drowsiness and right focal slowing as she became drowsy.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Excessive theta in early drowsiness.
Right focal slowing during drowsiness.
F7, T1 sharp waves in stage 2 sleep.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of right MCA stroke and bipolar disorder as well as seizure disorder.  She now presents with being found unresponsive on the floor.  She has approximately 1 seizure a month.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The recording was performed at bedside.  Some of the electrodes had high impedances due to poor patient cooperation throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is a right to left interhemispheric asymmetry with faster frequencies observed over the left hemisphere.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the left hemisphere consists of polymorphic moderate amplitude 8.5 to 9 Hz alpha activity.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the right hemisphere consists of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude 7 to 8 Hz theta.  The anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient is weak bilaterally.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.  Additional diffuse polymorphic theta is observed.  Intermittent left hemispheric sharp waves are captured.  Phase reversal occurs over F7, T1, T3 and Fp1, F3 electrodes.  There is nearly continuous EMG artifact that effects variable leads.  Premature QRS complexes are captured on a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Mild diffuse slowing.
Mild to moderate right hemispheric slowing.
Intermittent sharp waves over the left frontal/anterior temporal region.
Occasional premature QRS complexes seen on EKG.
EMG artifact that is nearly continuous effecting variable leads throughout the recording.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake only 23 minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing, mild to moderate right hemispheric slowing, as well as intermittent left frontal/anterior temporal epileptiform discharges.  Diffuse slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal right hemispheric slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, and is consistent with the patient's history of right MCA territory stroke.  There is an epileptogenic focus over the left frontal/anterior temporal region.  A large amount of EMG artifact is present throughout the recording, so subtle abnormalities might have been missed.  No clear electrographic seizures are captured.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10.5 Hz activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  The anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient is present, but weak.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present throughout the recording.  During drowsiness the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving multiple flash frequencies.

Excess beta.
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal awake and drowsy 22 minute EEG due to mild background disorganization.  This findings indicates etiologically nonspecific cerebral dysfunction.  The excess beta could be secondary to medication effect such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS:  Clonidine, tramadol, Depakote.  Propofol drip stopped 1-2 hours prior to the EEG.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was responsive during the EEG.  Prominent craniotomy changes were noted.  This is a somewhat technically challenging bedside ICU record.  The patient also had tender scalp and ideal impedances could not be obtained.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates an asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres.  The left hemisphere is medium amplitude with primarily 6 Hz theta and smaller amounts of delta.  The right hemisphere is a lower voltage, slower more featureless pattern, with a little bit of theta noted at the midline at CZ.  The patient is confused, but responsive at times and then drifts off to sleep with a slower pattern and a bit more delta on the left compared to the right.  The patient does seem to transition into more of a sleep state on the left intermittently with what may be somewhat asymmetric vertex waves, but deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Heart rate:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Marked slowing on the right.
Moderate slowing on the left, but with a definable drowsy and sleep pattern on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function effect.  The continuous focal slowing from the right with disturbance of faster frequency on the right is congruent with the right hemispheric infarct with mass effect and edema.  The slowing on the left may be due to the mass effect in shift or may be due to other diffuse disturbances.  No epileptiform features were identified.  These findings may be correlated with imaging as a fluid collection can attenuate EEG activity on the right.

TECHNICAL:  Impedance issues, patient cooperation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This bedside EEG demonstrates an asymmetry.  The right hemisphere is composed primarily of arrhythmic delta as well as some theta and smaller amounts of beta.  The left hemisphere on occasion includes some 7 Hz activity.  There is sharply-contoured slowing, some periodic slowing and even some sharp waves noted in the left hemisphere with variable maximum but more typically occipital or posterotemporal in nature.  On occasion, there is an alerting with a glimpse of an alpha rhythm on the left.

IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Intrahemispheric asymmetry with marked slowing on the right and disruption of faster-frequency activity.
Irregular slowing on the left with periodic slowing and occasional sharp waves in the left posterotemporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  The markedly slow pattern on the right with disruption of faster-frequency activity and arrhythmic delta activity is supportive of a process in the right involving gray and white matter.  The left
hemisphere is also slow and disorganized, with some sharp waves.  These findings may be correlated with a previous stroke on the left.  No seizures were identified.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was quite somnolent during the EEG and had a seizure.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing began, the background EEG was quite slow and disorganized.
Interictal epileptiform discharges were identified with low amplitude sharp waves seen primarily in the right temporal region.
A seizure was identified shortly after the start of the EEG around 2:06 a.m. lasting approximately 1 minute.  This was characterized by eye flutter.  The patient was on the video and it is a bit hazy but the technologist described eye flutter and the video also seems to generate an arousal.  The first seizure out of the right is about 1 minute long and as the epileptiform activity evolves and slows a second seizure lasting approximately 20 seconds is noted out of the left.  This is associated with much higher amplitude slow delta and it ends abruptly.  During the left temporal seizure the patient has repetitive jerking of the trunk that occurred during the second seizure.  The first seizure was at 2:19.
Low amplitude intermittent left temporal sharp waves were noted to follow this.
No additional seizures were noted on the baseline EEG.
Heart rate 102 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing.
A right temporal lobe seizure.
A second seizure which localizes to the left and seems to evolve just as the seizure out of the right ends.
Marked background slowing.
Heart rate reaching 150 bpm during the second seizure out of the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is diagnostic of the localization related epilepsy.  The clinical history with onset of seizures before 8 a.m., failure to awaken and the presence of this seizure on the EEG raises concerns about a later form of status epilepticus.

INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed using standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low to moderate amplitude 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eye opening.

During sleep symmetrical vertex waves and sleep spindles noted.  Intermittent polymorphic, often sharply contoured, theta and delta activity is captured over the left temporal region.  Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort and produces no significant change in the background.

FINDINGS:
Intermittent mild to moderate focal left temporal slowing, often sharply contoured.
Excess beta.
No clear epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and asleep 26 minute EEG due to intermittent mild to moderate focal left temporal slowing.  This finding indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  Excess beta could be secondary to the medication effect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 59-year-old woman with a history of meningioma resection in 2009, has had episodes of vertigo, headaches since December and with left-sided head pressure, electric shocks that make her shake every 1-2 days, increasing lately.  She also states that thunder has a negative effect on her.
MEDICATIONS:  Amitriptyline, metoprolol, aspirin, pravastatin, omeprazole, clonazepam.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches at 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is excessive frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness, stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen almost continuously at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  In addition, there is an asymmetrical increased amplitude and faster frequencies in this region consistent with a breach rhythm.  Please note that at times, there are sharply contoured discharges, but not clearly epileptiform.
Heart rate 78.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left midtemporal focal slowing and breach.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left midtemporal region, which is consistent with a known tumor resection surgery.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.  Please note that this is reported similar to the EEGs done in 2011, 2010 and 2009.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates an asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres.  The right hemisphere includes an 8 Hz alpha rhythm.  The left hemisphere demonstrates some underlying focal slowing in the left posterior temporal region with a breach rhythm, accentuation of amplitude in that region, some underlying delta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing.
In the context of a breach rhythm, there is an underlying, P3/T5 sharp waves, primarily noted at P3.
Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.  Hyperventilation produces some bilateral slowing.  Frontally predominant rhythmic theta was noted in hyperventilation.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing noted from both hemispheres, the left more so than the right.
Subtle underlying delta noted in the left hemisphere, particularly in the posterior quadrant.
Breach rhythm.
Subtle underlying left parietal sharp waves in the context of a breech rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  For this individual with a structural lesion and previous status epilepticus, this EEG is improved compared to other studies.  The patient is clearly awake with a well-formed alpha rhythm on the right, although it is a bit slow.  The focal features described above are compatible with the patient's known structural abnormality.  No seizures were recorded.

MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with on channel EKG.  Previous craniotomy defect was noted.  This was a technically satisfactory record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively low-voltage.  A 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm was identified bilaterally but it is somewhat higher amplitude on the left compared to the right.  The left hemisphere demonstrates a breech rhythm with accentuation of amplitude in that region and some head rocking artifact in the left centrotemporal region.  Hyperventilation was performed early in the record, producing an increase in amplitude and accentuating the difference between the two hemispheres.  This finding was also noted in drowsiness.  As the patient drifts in and out of sleep, there are bursts of paroxysmal rhythmic slowing, which are a little higher amplitude with accentuation of fast activity, again on the left compared to the right.  As the patient transitions into stage 2 sleep, spindle activity is noted.  The patient remains drifting in and out between stage 1 and stage 2 sleep during photic stimulation.  The tech attempt awaken the patient for photic stimulation but he keeps drifting back into stage 2 sleep.  Photic stimulation does not otherwise activate the record.
Heart rate 60 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
Subtle focal slowing from the left hemisphere.
Despite the prominent breach rhythm, in the transition to sleep, there does appear to be an F7, FP1 sharp wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to previous EEG, 05/12/2011, the overall background has improved.  The focal slowing on the left is not as prominent and has more of a centrotemporal localization.  Sharp waves today were noted, more from the left frontal region and were previously in the left temporal region.

MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Vimpat, Depakote, and Versed administered at approximately 8:54 a.m. on 08/14/2013.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1-T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The recording was reviewed intermittently by the attending neurologist.  The patient was equipped with the event button.  Medical staff notes and nursing staff notes were reviewed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is a right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with faster waveforms at lower amplitudes over the right hemisphere.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the right consists of polymorphic 8 Hz to 9.5 Hz activity with weak anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient and additional polymorphic theta and delta activity more pronounced anteriorly.  There is no posterior dominant rhythm over the left hemisphere, and there is no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient over the left hemisphere.  The background over the left hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity at higher amplitudes.  Additional underlying faster activity is observed over the left.  Normal sleep architecture including sleep spindles, slow-wave sleep, vertex waves are captured.  Sleep architecture is more pronounced over the left.  A prolonged seizure starts at approximately 7:55 a.m. on 08/14/2013.  Seizure ultimately ends at approximately 8:55 a.m. on 08/14/2013, after 2 mg of IV Versed.  Seizure starts with low-to-moderate amplitude, somewhat rhythmic sharp waves observed over the left occipital region.  This activity gradually spreads to contralateral occipital region.  As seizure evolves, sharp waves with after going slow waves increase in amplitude and decrease in frequency.  Seizure spreads throughout the left hemisphere.  Eventually, a reflection of this activity is observed over the right hemisphere.  Clinically, horizontal nystagmus is noted.  Once 2 mg of Ativan are administered at approximately 08:54:40 a.m., seizure stops approximately 15 seconds later.   Please note there is diffuse excess beta activity observed throughout the recording.
FINDINGS:
Mild diffuse slowing.
Moderate focal left hemispheric slowing.
Left hemispheric breach artifact most pronounced over the left parasagittal leads.
A prolonged, approximately 1-hour, focal left hemispheric seizure that starts over the left occipital region.
Seizure stops approximately 15 seconds after administration of Versed.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 24-hour continuous video EEG monitoring, due to:
Mild diffuse slowing, focal moderate left hemispheric slowing, and focal left hemispheric status epilepticus that starts over the left occipital region.  Mild diffuse slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific, mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
Focal left hemispheric slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, and in this patient at least partially related to the postictal slowing.
Focal left occipital status epilepticus lasting approximately 1 hour and stopping after 2 mg of Versed.

She presents for a “follow-up” EEG.  Seizures are characterized by dizzy spells, most recent seizure 1 week ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenytoin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically satisfactory EEG, although impedances in the T1-T2 electrodes were not ideal.  There was a fair amount of muscle and chew artifact noted in the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a small amount of disorganization with a low voltage, 10 Hz alpha rhythm and generous beta.  There is also some background theta noted.  Prominent theta frequency activity is noted in the temporal regions as the patient transitions in and out of sleep.  This is irregular, sharply contoured, and resembled wicket aside from its irregularity.  No definitive sharp waves are noted in these discharges, however.  Other features of drowsiness include an increase in beta and overall background slowing as well as attenuation of the alpha rhythm.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation was performed as the patient was drifting in and out of sleep and scant driving was noted.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
A mild degree of background disorganization for an adult of this age in wakefulness.
Sharply contoured theta noted in drowsiness, which resembles wicket but is somewhat irregular and somewhat more prominent on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive sharp waves or spikes were noted.  The paroxysmal discharges described above are outside of the range of normal for a benign variant but do not have the characteristic shape of an epileptiform discharge.  Despite this, they still may represent an inter-ictal discharge for this individual.  Additional EEG recording capturing deeper stages of sleep may be of use.  Alternatively, comparison with previous studies may be of value.

The patient subsequently found to have a small left occipital bleed.
MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat, Depakote and phenobarbital and 2 mg of Ativan this a.m.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed continuously.  Spike detector and seizure detector were activated.  Medical staff notes and nursing staff notes were reviewed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of low amplitude beta activity admixed with theta and delta.  Delta activity is more pronounced anteriorly especially over the left hemisphere.  Additional polymorphic delta is noted over the left hemisphere.  No normal sleep architecture is observed, but periods of quiescence are noted.  On 08/23/2013 between approximately 6:50 a.m. until approximately 7:59 a.m., approximately 8 electrographic seizures were observed.  They last from about 1 minute to 2-1/2 minutes.  One more seizure is observed after Ativan administration.  The seizures started with very low amplitude fast activity over the left occipital region that rapidly spread throughout the left hemisphere, decrease in frequency and increasing in amplitude.  As the seizure progresses, frequency of rhythmic activity decreases to approximately 3 Hz and gradually stops.  Clinically seizures are associated with rhythmic lateral gaze nystagmus to the right.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse background slowing.
Focal left hemispheric slowing.
Excess beta.
Multiple electrographic seizures between approximately 7:00 a.m. and 8 a.m. on 08/23/2013 that is improved with Ativan.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 24-hour continuous audio/video EEG monitoring due to moderate diffuse slowing, focal left hemispheric slowing, and multiple focal electrographic seizures that occur within 1 hour at the end of the recording epoch.  Diffuse slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction, that is in this case likely related to medication effect.  Focal left hemispheric slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction likely structural in etiology and at least partially related to postictal phenomenon.  Excessive beta could be secondary to medication effect such as benzodiazepines __________  There is an epileptogenic focus over the left occipital region and is consistent with a history of recent left occipital region bleed.  These findings were conveyed to the Neurology primary team.
