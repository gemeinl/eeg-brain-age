DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Digital video EEG is performed using standard
10/20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation. This is an awake through stage II sleep record in an individual who is very drowsy.
In maximum wakefulness there is an 8.8 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the alpha rhythm. Vertex waves are noted in sleep, as are post.
Hyperventilation produces a small degree of background slowing. The patient is falling asleep in photic stimulation.
Heart rate 60 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits but excessively drowsy patient.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are noted. The excessive drowsiness can be due to sleep deprivations, medications or a warm environment.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a well formed 9.3 Hz, 60 microvolts posterior dominant rhythm and a slow amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. In addition, there is some rhythmic temporal theta noted in the transition to sleep. Vertex waves are identified in stage 1 sleep with spindles. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. The patient is drifting off to sleep during photic stimulation. There is a single artifactual appearing sharp wave noted at FP2, F4 on 1 occasional followed by more well defined artifacts in the frontal region. These are seen only briefly and in the last quarter of the record.

HR: 55 bpm

IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are identified. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and epileptiform activity can be elusive. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged 1 hour study or an outpatient ambulatory study may be helpful to assess underlying seizure disorder.

MEDICATIONS: Alprazolam, Pantoprazole, Atenolol, Dilantin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is well organized with a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Photic stimulation elicits driving. After photic stimulation is over, the patient had some jerking of her shoulders but not in association with the flashing lights. After the photic stimulation continues, the recording continues and the patient had intermittent jerking of her shoulders. The shoulders jerk forwards and backwards.

The shoulder jerking is not associated with epileptiform activity in the EEG. It is sometimes associated with upwards thrusting of her upper chest. She stares straight ahead during the events.

As the record continues, a physician examines the patient. The interaction with the physician and the patient is associated with increasing motor activity including eye blinking, mouth opening and closing, a little bit of alternating movements to right or left, and then some rotatory movements of the torso. When the movements stop, the EEG shows a normal awake pattern. The patient is staring off to space after the event ends.

The event begins at 9:58 and lasts 7 minutes. Afterwards, there is intermittent jerking. Cognitive testing is not performed to make certain that the patient is responsive at the end of the EEG.

HR: 60 bpm


IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This patient had a 7-minute behavioral episode without EEG change. This recording suggests a behavioral event rather than an electrical seizure.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the overall EEG is relatively low voltage with generous beta and scant alpha rhythms. A breech rhythm is noted in the right hemisphere. There is also some electrode artifact, compatible with a deformity of the skull shape.
Hyperventilation is performed early in the record, producing an increase in the amplitude, augmenting the double phase reversing artifacts on the right and increasing some theta a bit more so on the right compared to the left. Features of drowsiness included increase in beta. In drowsiness, the focal slowing is a bit more apparent on the right with a mixture of rhythmic 3-5 Hz activity. Vertex waves are noted as the patient transitions in and out of sleep. There is  disruption of faster frequency activity on the right in the transition to sleep in the centrotemporal regions with a bit more prominent spindles in the central regions, in the region of the previous
craniotomy. Overall, most of the focal slowing in this record is centrotemporal. In the context of a breech rhythm, there are a handful of right central or frontal sharp waves. Photic stimulation is  performed while the patient is in stage 2 sleep. No significant driving response was noted.

The rare bursts of hypersynchronous slowing are noted in photic stimulation, but unfortunately this does seem to collide with the attempt to capture sleep.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Hypnagogic hypersynchrony is a normal variant.  If additional information is needed, a 1-hour study which does not need to be sleep
deprived but just simply to capture sleep may be helpful, if there are any additional questions.

Episodes:  The patient had 3 episodes throughout the recording.  The first one occurred at 12:34 p.m. at the onset of the recording where she started having left facial twitching, followed by unresponsiveness while continuing to have left facial twitching.  This event lasted for about 2 minutes and then the patient became reactive again.
The second event occurred at 8:18 p.m.  The patient suddenly started having left facial twitching and grimacing, as well as tightening her arms, as well as becoming unresponsive.  This was followed by staring and mouth movements.  The episode lasted for over 4 minutes.
At about 3:32 a.m. the patient suddenly started having diffuse body shaking and rocking, as well as facial twitching.  This was much more severe than the other ones.  She continued rocking, jerking, and being unresponsive.  Then after stopping the jerking she laid in bed and remained unresponsive and started moving her mouth rhythmically in a chewing fashion.  The whole event lasted for about 4.5 minutes.

Wicket activity is noted as is rhythmic temporal theta of drowsiness.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta.  Photic stimulation produces bilateral driving.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Given the normal variant identified above, a repeat study capturing deeper stages of sleep would be helpful to search for epileptiform features in this patient with newly diagnosed epilepsy.

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were observed.  Sleep deprivation might produce the changes described above.
LONG TERM MONITORING - # 12-72 â 06/19/2012 to 06/20/2012
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient recalls 3 episodes.  The first is on the 19th at noon where she felt a little startled.  The second was at 10 p.m. where she felt a mini aura characterized by tingling sensation on her face.  She did not recall an episode at 5:25, although she did push the button for a tingling sensation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Random wakefulness and sleep includes a well-organized 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta activity.
Event time 11:22:  There is a burst of rhythmic left temporal theta delta with frequency evolution.  This is 5 seconds in duration.  There is no push button at that time.
Event time 5:25:20 p.m.:   A burst of rhythmic theta, frequency was subtle, frequency evolution lasting only 3 seconds.  Thirty seconds later the patient reports the mini-aura which she no longer recalled.
Event time 9:58 p.m.  No abnormalities on the EEG were identified at that time.
Event time10:25 a.m.:  There was another burst lasting 4 seconds in duration in the morning on the 20th which is similar to the 2 prior bursts.   No clinical features were recalled.
HR:    60 bpm
INTERVAL IMPRESSION:  There are 3 bursts of rhythmic theta from the left temporal region with frequency evolution.  These are concerning as a potential interictal epileptiform discharge.  They may also be clinically significant with the mini-auras that the patient experienced.
LONG TERM MONITORING - # 12- 72 â 06/20/2012 TO 06/21/2012
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a well defined 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  This is a sleep deprived record.  Around 10:00 p.m. the patient seems to be trying to stay up.  The EEG demonstrates small EPOCHS where the patient seems to be drowsy.   Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K-complexes, and spindles. The data is reviewed for the clinical symptoms that the patient experienced, but no epileptiform features are identified.
HR:    66 bpm
LONG TERM MONITORING - # 12-72 â 06/21/2012 TO 06/22/2012
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient reported an aura at 8 p.m. on the 21st.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Around 8 p.m., the patient is noted to transition in and out of stage 2 sleep, waking up and falling back asleep.  Fragments of deeper stages of sleep are noted overnight.
No electrographic seizures were identified.  The seizure and spike detector did not identify any other epileptiform abnormalities.
Event time 11:55:  The patient pushes the button at 11:56:12 stating that she feels as if she is about to have an aura.  She puts her hand to her chest and later appears to be tearful.  The EEG is awake at this time.  No epileptiform features were noted.   For her 8:00 p.m. the patient reported symptoms that her throat was closing with the seizure.

HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for:
3 bursts of rhythmic, paroxysmal theta, all less than 4 seconds in duration, but with frequency evolution.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's clinical symptoms did not appear to be associated with well-defined epileptiform abnormalities.  On one day, however, there were discharges which appear epileptiform in nature.  While this patient did not have any of her larger spells with head turning, a feeling as if her throat was closing or impairment of awareness, this record does not exclude a diagnosis and clinically, diagnosis may be considered.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta.  The drowsy pattern is relatively symmetric and on rare occasions, the slow activity seems to be slightly slower on the right compared to the left.  This is more apparent with the use of frequency analysis.  Hyperventilation produces bilateral theta.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous, bilateral driving with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.  There is vigorous harmonic driving and supraharmonic driving identified from both hemispheres.  The driving response is higher amplitude on the left compared to the right, but the overall frequency differences are relatively symmetric.  On some occasions, the supraharmonic driving seems to be bit a more prominent on the right.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was an awake and a sleep record in very drowsy individual.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm, exceeding 70 mV with posterior slow waves of youth.  In drowsiness there is hypersynchronous rhythmic higher amplitude theta frequency activity âhypnogogicâ, âhypersynchronyâ.  There were 1 or 2 points of head rocking artifact and there were 1-2 bursts which are slightly asynchronous. Hyperventilation produces hypersynchronous rhythmic high amplitude, somewhat sharply contoured theta frequency activity, but no definitive spike and wave activity.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Mu activity, as well as lambda was identified. The patient appears to be very sleepy, transitions in and out of stage II sleep.  Spindle activity is noted.  There seem to be fragments of sleep spindles just as she is dropping almost in and out wakefulness.  As the sleep record continues, more abundant stage II sleep is identified, but in the transition in and out of stage II sleep, there are fragments of early drowsiness, almost emerging into a stage II sleep pattern. The patient is awakened at the end of the test and answers complex questions. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:   66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Somewhat unusual, but normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no epileptiform features, but there are multiple normal variants, including mu and rhythmic temporal theta of drowsiness. Given the transitions noted early in the record between wakefulness and stage II sleep, an underlying sleep deficit may account for this.  If there is any other question, a follow up study when the patient has had adequate sleep may be of value.

The background consists of very low amplitude diffuse fast activity without clear posterior dominant rhythm.  During hyperventilation bursts of diffuse delta are observed.  Photic stimulation does not result in change in the background.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.  Sinus bradycardia with heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute is captured in a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Sinus bradycardia.
Excess beta.
No sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake-only EEG.  No epileptiform discharges are captured, but stage II sleep is not recorded.  If clinical diagnosis for seizures persists, a
repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.  Sinus bradycardia with heart rate of less than 60 is captured in a single EKG lead.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 19-year-old woman with a family history of epilepsy who presents with episodes described as foot shaking, stomach jumping, feeling of dizziness, and hot.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the lab  using the standard International 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to one channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness only.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 9 to 10 Hz in frequency, 30 to 40 microvolt in amplitude seen the occipital region which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity which is distributed symmetrically.  Hyperventilation results in symmetric slowing of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple/frequencies and resulted in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate is 60 to 70 beats per minute and regular.
CLINICAL EVENTS:  A 10:00:43 the patient reported that she has an attack described as her stomach is jumping with her arm on top of it.  She added that this is part of her attack.  At 10:06:01 she reported that she is feeling hot.  At 10:11:54 she stated that she is seeing blinking red stuff that hurts.  EEG showed a normal awake pattern with a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz.  Eye blink artifact, lateral eye movement artifacts and muscle artifact with no epileptiform activity during this event.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness only.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.  The episodes were characterized by clinical events of jumping stomach, feeling hot, and seeing blinking red stuff without any significant EEG correlation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This study does not support the diagnosis of epilepsy.  The episodes are diagnostic for psychogenic nonepileptiform events.  Although this study does not exclude the possibility of epilepsy and intermittent seizures, if seizures are a clinical concern a prolonged ambulatory EEG may be helpful to capture other types of events.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in central theta and beta.  Vertex waves were observed in brief stage 1 sleep, as were POSTs.
Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous bilateral driving response.  Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta as well as beta.
Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 1 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Previous EEGs were not available for comparison.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If additional information is needed, a repeat study, capturing one of her typical seizures may be of value.  This is the fourth normal EEG for this patient including a previous, sleep-deprived EEG.

MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Condition of the recording:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.    Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of  well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  This alpha activity is higher in amplitude over the right.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with higher frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During very brief drowsiness at the end of the recording bursts of diffuse polymorphic theta and delta is captured.  Hyperventilation does not result in significant change in the background.  Stepped stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and briefly drowsy 24 minute EEG.  The asymmetry of posterior dominant rhythm observed is within normal limits.  No epileptiform discharges are captured, however, Stage II sleep is not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizure persists a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.

Throughout the recording there are frequent polymorphic intrusions of diffuse theta and delta.  Drowsiness is present, but stage II sleep is not recorded.  Hyperventilation results in mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
No stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and briefly drowsy 23 minute EEG.  Diffuse intrusions of theta and delta activity likely represent a normal variant.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persist, a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the laboratory using the standard international 10/20 system of electrode placement in addition to T1 and T2 electrodes and 1-channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness only.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 9-10 Hz in frequency, 30-40 microvolt in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Hyperventilation results in symmetric slowing of the background activity.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in symmetric driving response.  Heart rate is 70-80 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness only.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy if seizures are a clinical concern.  A repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the lab using the standard international 10/20 system of electrode placement in addition to 1-channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through a stage II sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 8.5-9 Hz in frequency and 30-35 microvolts in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is 6-7 Hz diffuse theta activity seen during wakefulness.  There is presence of low amplitude diffuse beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Stage I sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm and slowing of the background activity and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact as well as the presence of the vertex sharp waves.  Stage II sleep was captured characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles. Heart rate was 90-100 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to excess theta activity during wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings could be due to toxic metabolic hypoxic or infectious encephalopathy, alternatively it could be due to the effect of sedating medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  The generalized beta activity could be due to medication effect including phenobarbital or hyperthyroidism.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No epileptiform discharges abnormalities or seizures were captured during this record.  If clinically indicated, a repeat sleep deprived EEG or continuous bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.  The absence of epileptiform activities or seizures does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.

REASON FOR STUDIES:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 33-year-old right handed woman presents with history of seizures since March 2011 described as an aura, a metallic taste, loss of consciousness, tongue biting, bladder incontinence, afterwards confused for hours.  Last seizure was on Saturday.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, clonazepam, tramadol, Advair, albuterol, sertraline, Sudafed, amantadine, Motrin, temazepam.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is an excessive amount of beta throughout the recording.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
The heart rate is 54.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
EPISODES:
During the recording as photic stimulation was being performed the patient started stuttering and her right arm started shaking and trembling for a period of 11 minutes.  The patient is responsive throughout the whole period; however, the code word which she was asked to memorize and later asked to repeat was repeated incorrectly at the end of the event.  During this event the EEG appeared to be normal with no epileptiform activity seen or EEG correlate seen.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  The episode described above, which started on with the right arm shaking did not reveal any EEG correlate, as such it may represent a nonepileptic event or alternatively it may be a simple partial seizure, which in up to 75% of the cases do not have any EEG correlate.  Lastly, please note that the excessive beta noted on the EEG may be due to a medication effect.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using a standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 9-10 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta-activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  A stage 1 sleep is characterized with disappearance of the alpha rhythm slowing of the background and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and POSTS.  Stage 2 sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  Hyperventilation results in symmetric slowing of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate was 70 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through stage II sleep.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm was 10-11 Hz in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is diffuse low amplitude beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Stage I sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and posts.  A stage II was characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  Hyperventilation results in symmetric slowing of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate was 70 beats per minutes and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through stage II sleep.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are a clinical concern, the repeat EEG or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.  The generalized beta activity could be due to medication effect including benzodiazepine, barbiturates, or could be due to anxiety or hyperthyroidism.  Clinical correlation is recommended.

Apparently she fainted and was on the floor for 15 seconds and then was observed to shake.  Of note, during the recording here in the laboratory, there was a brief episode of right hemibody tingling.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The recording start time was 11:29 a.m.  The recording end time was 12 noon.  The recording length was 25 minutes.
As the record opens there is a well formed and symmetric 9-10 Hz  posterior dominant rhythm that is reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of frontal central beta activity that is symmetrically distributed.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm.  At approximately 11:45 a.m., approximately 15 minutes into the recording epic, the patient complained of right hemibody tingling and numbness.  She was examined by the physician in the laboratory at the time, and there were no obvious clinical sequela.  During this time, there was no change in the background cerebral activity of the EEG.
Hyperventilation was performed for 3 minutes with good effort and failed to activate the tracing.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and induced a very reactive and responsive photic driving response at intermediate flash frequency ranges.  The patient's heart rate ranged from 70-90 beats during the record epic.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the laboratory using the standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to T1 and T2 electrodes and 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through stage 1 sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 9-10 Hz seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  A stage 1 sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and posts.  Hyperventilation results in symmetrical slowing of the background activity.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate is 60 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through stage 1 sleep.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG, does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.

HISTORY:  A 62-year-old woman with past medical history of anxiety that has been having constant jerking episodes when falling asleep of her extremities, abdomen and face that lately have worsened in frequency and have become intolerable and do not permit her to go to sleep.  She is here for classification of these episodes, rule out seizures/myoclonus versus nonepileptic spells.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Overall, the background appears to be normal.  However, as the patient becomes drowsy, intermittent muscle artifact jerks can be seen throughout the recording, at times the EMG artifact could be noted more over the left temporalis muscle than the right.  There appears to be no preceding cortical discharge prior to this muscle artifact.  The video does not reveal clear facial jerks although the technician reports that she noticed some facial jerking irregularly. At one point, the patient does have some abdominal flexion which occurs congruously or at the same time as the muscle artifact occurred. Again, none of these artifacts have a preceding cortical discharge that could be clearly seen.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
The patient is a 71-year-old man who had an episode of loss of consciousness after a coughing spell.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  The recording was performed at the laboratory.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include amlodipine, Lantus, lovastatin and others.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated low  amplitude 10.5-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitude anteriorly.  A faster alpha variant is occasionally observed.  During periods of sleep symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes are captured.  Additionally, brief bursts of bitemporal delta are observed during sleep as well.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and does not result in significant changes in background.  __________ photic stimulation results in simple driving and multiple flash frequencies.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a heart rate as low as 36 beats a minute during sleep and approximately 60 beats a minute during wakefulness.
FINDINGS:
Profound bradycardia with heart rate as low as 36 beats a minute during sleep.

No epileptiform discharges were captured; however, the patient's sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indications for seizures persists, a study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 28-year-old woman with a history of seizures since the age of 18.  Last event was approximately 1 week ago.  Seizures are described as head thrashing with associated tongue biting and urinary incontinence.  The patient had head trauma in June 2012.  She also reports migraines.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Keppra, Remeron, Synthroid.  Clonidine was stopped 1 week ago.
CONDITION OF RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was  performed.  Photic stimulation was attempted but stopped prematurely as per patient request due to patient having a migraine.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 9-9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness symmetrical vertex waves are captured.  The patient's sleep is very brief and symmetrical sleep spindles are observed.  Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort and produces no change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation is stopped early due to patient request.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Very brief stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and very briefly asleep 22-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

Most recent seizure June/July 2012 with fainting, falling, and shaking.  Now 4 months pregnant.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was an awake and asleep record.
TECHNICAL:  Impedances for most of the electrodes were satisfactory, but this EEG was problematic with a great degree of muscle artifact when the patient was awake.  As the patient went off to sleep, there was still muscle artifact picked up in the left scalp electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Despite the problems described above, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of focal frontal central beta.  Wicket was noted as the patient became drowsy.  Other features with drowsiness include rhythmic central theta.  The electrode artifact did not drop out in stage I sleep with vertex waves.  Brief stage II sleep included vertex waves with spindles.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation was remarkable for a great deal of muscle artifact.  Heart rate 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a technically challenging but otherwise normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The wicket is a normal finding.  Given the degree of muscle artifact described above, a follow-up study capturing perhaps more prolonged
sleep or with other mechanisms to alleviate the muscle artifact is suggested.  Alternatively, comparison with this individual's childhood EEGs may be of value.
