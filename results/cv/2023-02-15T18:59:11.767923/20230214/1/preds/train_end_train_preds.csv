INTRODUCTION; Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a well formed 9.3 Hz, 60 microvolts posterior dominant rhythm and a slow amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. In addition, there is some rhythmic temporal theta noted in the transition to sleep. Vertex waves are identified in stage 1 sleep with spindles. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. The patient is drifting off to sleep during photic stimulation. There is a single artifactual appearing sharp wave noted at FP2, F4 on 1 occasional followed by more well defined artifacts in the frontal region. These are seen only briefly and in the last quarter of the record.

HR: 55 bpm

IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are identified. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and epileptiform activity can be elusive. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged 1 hour study or an outpatient ambulatory study may be helpful to assess underlying seizure disorder.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a very low voltage pattern. Stage I sleep includes vertex waves with vertex waves, POSTS and a few spindles in stage II sleep. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Photic stimulation is performed although the patient is relatively drowsy. There is no discernible driving response.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Low voltage but relatively normal EEG in sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Due to the F8 electrode artifact, this is an unsatisfactory study. The low voltage pattern in limited wakefulness is of unclear significance. No epileptiform features were seen but this EEG is not a complete evaluation.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient appears to be quite drowsy with
generous beta and a 1 0 Hz alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation is performed early-on in the
record. It produces a small amount of slowing. There are some technical issues with
suboptimal right occipital temporal electrode placement. Immediately after
hyperventilation, the patient falls asleep with vertex waves. The patient drifts off into
stage II sleep. A muscle monitor was not employed during this EEG. She Is awakened
for photic stimulation. She seems to be restless during photic stimulation but there is a
driving response. She also drifts back into stage II sleep during photic stimulation.
HR: 90bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen. This patient's
myoclonus was not recorded. Total sleep time for this EEG was only 12 minutes. A
followup, 1 hour EEG should be performed with a muscle twitch monitor to assess for
myoclonus as well as to determine whether or not there are unusual sleep epochs
captured in a routine EEG. If additional information is needed, please consider a polysomnogram.

artifact but there also appears to be attenuation on the right. Multiple artifacts are noted
from the left occipital region which are not corrected during the EEG. Photic stimulation
is performed while the patient is asleep. Very little stimulation of the patient is performed
and this stimulation Is performed within the last few minutes of the test and does not
serve to alert the patient.
HR: 60bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG
CLINICAL This EEG include electrode artifact on the right as well as
an inability to adequately stimulate the patient. Consequently focal features may be
under recognized. In addition, additional testing to make sure that it is possible to record
an awake individual is necessary.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm.  On some occasions, the alpha rhythm is a little higher amplitude activity on the left than the right.  There is a bit of head rocking activity on the right compared to the left.  Hyperventilation is performed early in the record, producing an increase in theta.  Following this, as the patient becomes drowsy, the EEG is a bit more synchronous with higher amplitude and more anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

The patient transitions quickly between wakefulness into stage 1 and stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles and POSTS.  The stage 1 sleep record is relatively low voltage. The patient is falling asleep during photic stimulation and there is no driving identified.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  There is also a small degree of slowing.
HR:     66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a well-identified 11 Hz alpha rhythm which reaches 70 microvolts.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record.  There is some eye movement artifact, but no definite focal slowing.  The tech uses eye pads to reduce eye blink artifact.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving with supra harmonic driving.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in rhythmicity of the background as well as anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  A single burst of paroxysmal rhythmic slowing is noted if the patient transitions to sleep but then photic stimulation is performed. The rare bursts of hypersynchronous slowing are noted in photic stimulation, but unfortunately this does seem to collide with the attempt to capture sleep.

IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Hypnagogic hypersynchrony is a normal variant.  If additional information is needed, a 1-hour study which does not need to be sleep
deprived but just simply to capture sleep may be helpful, if there are any additional questions.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, this is a relatively low voltage EEG.  In maximal wakefulness there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is a fair amount of muscle artifact in maximal wakefulness.  Slightly asymmetric vertex waves are noted in stage I sleep.  Other features of sleep include vertex waves and brief spindles in stage II sleep.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
Heart rate 60-84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal single lead EEG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation produced no abnormal discharges, however, see below for photic stimulation.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
EVENTS:  During photic stimulation, the patient started having slow movements of her head side to side then started twitching her upper extremities and moving her body towards the right side and appeared to be unresponsive to commands.  This episode lasted for a period of about 40 seconds and then she remained with her eyes closed and appeared to be slightly more responsive.  Minutes later, photic stimulation was performed again after she had opened her eyes and appeared to have followed commands.  At that point she started jerking her left shoulder slowly, then trembling her upper extremities and again falling towards the right side of the seat.  This second episode lasted for about approximately a minute and 20 seconds.  During both episodes, the EEG revealed a normal awake background with no epileptiform abnormalities and no EEG correlate to this behavior described above.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG with two episodes of shaking during photic stimulation with no EEG correlate.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and asleep EEG with no seizures or epileptiform discharges.  The episodes captured above had no EEG correlate and are consistent with nonepileptic events.  No seizure.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm, exceeding 70 mV with posterior slow waves of youth.  In drowsiness there is hypersynchronous rhythmic higher amplitude theta frequency activity “hypnogogic”, “hypersynchrony”.  There were 1 or 2 points of head rocking artifact and there were 1-2 bursts which are slightly asynchronous. Hyperventilation produces hypersynchronous rhythmic high amplitude, somewhat sharply contoured theta frequency activity, but no definitive spike and wave activity. The patient transitions in and out of stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles.  Other features of drowsiness include the hypersynchronous rhythmic theta.
Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.

IMPRESSION:  This EEG demonstrates multiple normal variants for a young adult.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There was no definitive spike and wave activity, although hyperventilation did produce some rhythmic high amplitude theta.  There were a handful of slightly asynchronous bursts as the patient transitions to drowsiness.  If absence seizures are an important consideration, a repeat fasting EEG, perhaps with a second hyperventilation session maybe helpful.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Voltages are diffusely very low. The background is symmetric.  There is right-to-left interhemispheric symmetry.  The background consists of very low amplitude diffuse fast activity without clear posterior dominant rhythm.  During hyperventilation bursts of diffuse delta are observed.  Photic stimulation does not result in change in the background.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.  Sinus bradycardia with heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute is captured in a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Sinus bradycardia.
Excess beta.
No sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake-only EEG.  No epileptiform discharges are captured, but stage II sleep is not recorded.  If clinical diagnosis for seizures persists, a
repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.  Sinus bradycardia with heart rate of less than 60 is captured in a single EKG lead.

MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the lab  using the standard International 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to one channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness only.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 9 to 10 Hz in frequency, 30 to 40 microvolt in amplitude seen the occipital region which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity which is distributed symmetrically.  Hyperventilation results in symmetric slowing of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple/frequencies and resulted in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate is 60 to 70 beats per minute and regular.
CLINICAL EVENTS:  A 10:00:43 the patient reported that she has an attack described as her stomach is jumping with her arm on top of it.  She added that this is part of her attack.  At 10:06:01 she reported that she is feeling hot.  At 10:11:54 she stated that she is seeing blinking red stuff that hurts.  EEG showed a normal awake pattern with a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz.  Eye blink artifact, lateral eye movement artifacts and muscle artifact with no epileptiform activity during this event.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness only.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.  The episodes were characterized by clinical events of jumping stomach, feeling hot, and seeing blinking red stuff without any significant EEG correlation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This study does not support the diagnosis of epilepsy.  The episodes are diagnostic for psychogenic nonepileptiform events.  Although this study does not exclude the possibility of epilepsy and intermittent seizures, if seizures are a clinical concern a prolonged ambulatory EEG may be helpful to capture other types of events.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  The patient was very uncomfortable prior to the EEG and was experiencing one of her headaches.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10-Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm with slow-rolling eye movements and central theta.  Stage II sleep was not sustained.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting in and out of sleep and did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The generous beta described above may represent this patient's medication effect or anxiety.  This is the third EEG for this patient without epileptiform activity.

Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous bilateral driving response.  Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta as well as beta.
Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 1 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Previous EEGs were not available for comparison.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If additional information is needed, a repeat study, capturing one of her typical seizures may be of value.  This is the fourth normal EEG for this patient including a previous, sleep-deprived EEG.

MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Condition of the recording:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.    Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of  well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  This alpha activity is higher in amplitude over the right.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with higher frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During very brief drowsiness at the end of the recording bursts of diffuse polymorphic theta and delta is captured.  Hyperventilation does not result in significant change in the background.  Stepped stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and briefly drowsy 24 minute EEG.  The asymmetry of posterior dominant rhythm observed is within normal limits.  No epileptiform discharges are captured, however, Stage II sleep is not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizure persists a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the laboratory using the standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement, in addition to T1 and T2 electrodes and 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through stage II sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 10.5 to 11.5 Hz in frequency, 30-40 microvolts in amplitude seen in the occipital region which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Stage I sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact, as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and POSTS.  Stage II sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  Hyperventilation results in symmetrical slowing of the background activity.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate was 70 to 80 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through stage II sleep.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are clinical concern, a repeat EEG or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.

The patient remained lethargic.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Ativan, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG monitoring was performed using the standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement and 1 channel of EKG monitoring.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Records were daily reviewed for EEG abnormalities and clinical events, wakefulness, stage 2 sleep, and a slow wave sleep were captured.  There was an automated spike and seizure detection system in place as well as the patient activated alarm system.  The patient was drowsy with short periods of wakefulness during this recording.
Interictal EEG:  In the most alert state, there was a posterior dominant rhythm with a frequency of 9-9.5 Hz and 25-40 microvolts seen in the occipital region, which attenuated with eye opening.  There was presence of low-amplitude diffuse beta frequency, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness, stage 1 and a stage 2 sleep were seen during the most part of this recording.  Stage 1 sleep was characterized by the disappearance of the alpha rhythm slowing of the background and absence of eye blink and muscle artifact, vertex sharp waves, and POSTS.  Stage 2 sleep was characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles, and POSTS.  The deeper stages of sleep have characterized by increasing amounts of delta frequency activity.  There were no epileptiform activities or seizures were captured during this recording.  Heart rate was 90 to 110 beats per minute.
CLINICAL EVENTS:  No clinical events were captured during this recording.  The patient was drowsy, but arousable by calling the patient.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG monitoring study capturing short periods of wakefulness and for the most part of the recording drowsiness stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.  There were no epileptiform activities or seizures noted during this recording.  This EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are of a clinical concern, a repeat prolonged video EEG monitoring may be helpful.  Please note that the patient was tachycardiac.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was attempted in the laboratory using standard a 10-20 System of electrode placement, with 1 channel of EKG.  Significant technical difficulties included the hair weaves that the patient has.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Despite the problems with electrode placement and impedance, the background EEG is appropriately organized, with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  The referential montage was not particularly successful.  Features of drowsiness included an increase in background slowing.  In addition, very brief stage I sleep was seen, with vertex waves and then a transition in and out of stage I sleep.  At the very close of the record, the patient was transitioning in and out of stage II sleep.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.  Heart rate 84 bpm, occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging but normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The transitions in and out of stage II sleep may reflect sleep deprivation or an underlying sleep disturbance, which could be correlated with this patient's clinical picture.  To obtain a better quality EEG, a repeat study, when the patient has had her hair weaves removed, is suggested.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This was a very drowsy patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there was a 10.5-Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient quickly transitioned to a drowsy pattern with prominent slowing of the alpha rhythm. Vertex waves were noted in stage 1 sleep.  As the patient drifted off to sleep, there was an involuntary jerk of the right leg. This was not associated with epileptiform features.  Cognitive testing was performed at the end to make sure that the patient was maximally awake and there was an awake pattern and then the patient quickly started to become a little drowsy with slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.  Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits for an adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform activity was noted.  Sleep myoclonus was noted on one occasion which does not carry an EEG correlate.  This patient appears to be excessively drowsy which could be related to sleep deprivation or the use of opiate medications as described above.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 61-year-old man with a recent pontine hemorrhage, now with worsening mental status since this a.m., 01/02/2013.  EEG is performed since there is a possibility of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol, Colace, ciprofloxacin, nystatin.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  Voltages are diffusely low.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the left hemisphere consists of low amplitude 8-9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient over the left hemisphere with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  There is nearly continuous EMG artifact over the right hemispheric leads that obscures most of the right hemispheric recording.  No sleep architecture is observed.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
FINDINGS:
Nearly continuous EMG artifact over the right hemispheric leads that obscures those leads.  This EMG artifact makes interpretation of the activity over the right hemisphere not reliable.
No clear epileptiform discharges.
No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake only 22-minute EEG.  There is nearly continuous EMG artifact over the right hemispheric leads that obscures significant portions of the recording over the right hemispheric leads.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Five minutes hyperventilation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, this is a very useful appearing EEG with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm reaching 80 microvolts with prominent, posterior slow waves of youth.
Hyperventilation was performed early on the record producing bursts of rhythmic, synchronous theta and delta again with a slight posterior predominance.  Following hyperventilation, as the patient became drowsy, hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing was identified.  Other features of sleep include vertex waves and multiple transitions in and out of sleep.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response with harmonic and supra harmonic driving.  In addition, on occasion during photic stimulation, the patient was becoming drowsy with bursts of paroxysmal slowing, but without definitive spike and slow wave activity.
Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits for a young adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this EEG.  There are multiple, youthful findings noted in this EEG, but no pathological features were noted.
The previous EEG demonstrated some of these same youthful findings, but raised some concern as to possible underlying spike and wave activity.

Previous EEGs.  He has hearing impairment and attention deficit disorder.  At age 15 he had 2.5 Hz spike and wave activity on an outside EEG, but by age 17 his EEG had become normal.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and briefly drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates an appropriate pattern for a young adult of this age with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm reaching 90 mV.  The alpha rhythm is sometimes a little higher amplitude on the left compared to the right.
Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.  Posterior slow waves of youth were noted in wakefulness.  Although deeper stages of sleep were not achieved, just as the patient was becoming drowsy there seems to be some subtle underlying 4-5 Hz theta in the left occipital region.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.
Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response.
Heart:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  A very subtle abnormality was noted in this EEG just as the patient was becoming drowsy and included some focal theta in the left occipital parietal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  For this individual with a history of early developmental pathology and possible meningitis, these findings may relate to that premorbid process.  The findings were seen in a very
restricted section of the EEG.  If there is any questions, additional EEG recording may be of value.

MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The recording start time was 11:29 a.m.  The recording end time was 12 noon.  The recording length was 25 minutes.
As the record opens there is a well formed and symmetric 9-10 Hz  posterior dominant rhythm that is reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of frontal central beta activity that is symmetrically distributed.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm.  At approximately 11:45 a.m., approximately 15 minutes into the recording epic, the patient complained of right hemibody tingling and numbness.  She was examined by the physician in the laboratory at the time, and there were no obvious clinical sequela.  During this time, there was no change in the background cerebral activity of the EEG.
Hyperventilation was performed for 3 minutes with good effort and failed to activate the tracing.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and induced a very reactive and responsive photic driving response at intermediate flash frequency ranges.  The patient's heart rate ranged from 70-90 beats during the record epic.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG capturing wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does no rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  The brief clinical event of right hemibody numbness and tingling were not associated with changes in the background cerebral activity.  Thus, this event is likely a nonepileptic event.

IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness for a short period of time through stage 2 sleep for most part of this recording.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were identified in this recording.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Generalized beta activity could be due to medication effect including benzodiazepine, barbiturates, or could be due to anxiety or hyperthyroidism.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were seen in this recording.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are of clinical concern, a repeat EEG when patient is more awake is recommended.

HISTORY:  A 62-year-old woman with past medical history of anxiety that has been having constant jerking episodes when falling asleep of her extremities, abdomen and face that lately have worsened in frequency and have become intolerable and do not permit her to go to sleep.  She is here for classification of these episodes, rule out seizures/myoclonus versus nonepileptic spells.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Overall, the background appears to be normal.  However, as the patient becomes drowsy, intermittent muscle artifact jerks can be seen throughout the recording, at times the EMG artifact could be noted more over the left temporalis muscle than the right.  There appears to be no preceding cortical discharge prior to this muscle artifact.  The video does not reveal clear facial jerks although the technician reports that she noticed some facial jerking irregularly. At one point, the patient does have some abdominal flexion which occurs congruously or at the same time as the muscle artifact occurred. Again, none of these artifacts have a preceding cortical discharge that could be clearly seen.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  66.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy EEG.  No seizures were seen.  Please note that the jerking episodes described above had no clear cortical or electrographic discharge and may be muscular discharges or possible myoclonus of subcortical origin.  No clear seizures were seen.
