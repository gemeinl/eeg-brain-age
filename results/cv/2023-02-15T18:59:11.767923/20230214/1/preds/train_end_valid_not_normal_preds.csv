MEDICATIONS:  Codeine, Trileptal, Crestor, ASA

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation is performed.  Technically this EEG is remarkable for a great deal of muscle and motion artifact.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is somewhat poorly organized. There is also a great degree of muscle artifact.  Superimposed upon this are bursts of rhythmic and arrhythmic delta activity in the right hemisphere.   The activity from the right frontal region tends to be rhythmic delta activity.  Underlying sharp waves are noted in this sharply contoured record and include T4/C4 and FP2. Features of drowsiness include additional bursts of paroxysmal high amplitude delta with an underlying right frontal sharp wave.	Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR:   84 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	FIRDA.
2. 	Paroxysmal slowing in the right frontal region.
3.	Sharp waves from the right, many of which are frontal, but some of which are temporal.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are similar to previous study with both a right hemispheric  process and background slowing and disorganization.  This is the first EEG in 1.5 years.  The patient had been relatively seizure free since February 2008.

INTRODUCTION: Digital EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1  channel  of EKG.  Only photic stimulation could be performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is moderately slow with background theta.  There are intermittent shifting asymmetries.  The waking record is less asymmetric and there is, at times, a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, but
in drowsiness the most common asymmetry is disruption of theta frequency activity in the left relevant to the right with faster pattern on the right, but there are shifting asymmetries.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is primarily drowsy.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In drowsy EEG, the background includes primarily a theta frequency pattern. Despite the artifacts, once again independent right or left anterior temporal sharp waves are identified at one point relatively frequent on the right but clearly bilateral. Features of drowsiness are as described above with an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation seems to elicit a driving response and unfortunately there is a great deal of artifact in the record:

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Independent, right or left temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Despite the problems with the record described above, the sharp waves can clearly be differentiated from artifacts. They are more prominent on the right today, but were previously identified form both right and left.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and 1 channel of EKG. There was no hyperventilation or photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly low voltage and is very slow. There are some technical issues with the record in addition to eye movement artifact. There are some frontal sharp waves which are of higher amplitude on the left. Unfortunately, eye movement artifacts also appear higher on the left. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta. Stimulation of patient produces little but more of theta.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Diffusely depressed with possible sharp waves in the left frontal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing could be a post ictal phenomenon or due to the patient's metabolic abnormalities. His medications, the use of Ativan, could also contribute to this pattern. If the patient does not improve a followup study should be considered.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient is poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern, poorly organized with mixture of irregular theta, some beta activity, some alpha frequency activity and delta. There is a suggestion of a 7 hertz posterior dominant rhythm seen on occasion. As the tracing continues, the patient is a bit more agitated with muscle and movement artifact, but when she calms down, it is more of a mixed frequency theta pattern with a suggestion of some underlying delta in the right occipital region.

simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG
demonstrates a well developed symmetric reactive 9 hertz alpha rhythm reaching 80
microvolts. Occasional, frontally predominant bursts of high amplitude, 3-5 hertz spike
and slow wave activity are identified in wakefulness. They are accentuated in early
drowsiness and by hyperventilation. Bursts are typically frontally predominant and
symmetrical although there are a handful that demonstrate shifting symmetry and rare
bursts that are occipitally predominant. Photic stimulation elicits driving, but does not
seem to accentuate the spike in wave activity.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Frontally predominant 3-5 hertz spike in wave activity.
2. Occasional spike in wave discharge which may be a little bit more asymmetric or
posteriorly predominant
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings have been identified in this patient's
previous EEGs. They are most supportive of a primary generalized mechanism for
epilepsy, but could be seen in a secondary generalized mechanism.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is poorly cooperative today.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates almost exclusively muscle and a slow background. There are brief sections where a discernible underlying left anterior temporal sharp wave is noted with a generous field of spread in the left hemisphere. The epileptiform activity is not monomorphic, some of it has more of an anterior spread, mid temporal spread, and it clearly involves even the left parietal region. Epileptiform activity is likely, easily under recognized because of the muscle artifact. At the close of the record there are a few more sharp waves.

1. Generalized background slowing with more of a rhythmic theta pattern.
2. Beneath the muscle artifact there is epileptiform activity which at least at the close of the record is actually periodic in nature.

subdural hematoma requiring craniotomy. She is postoperative day 4.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Serax, Ativan, Gentamicin, Thiamine, Folate Acid
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and is in a hard collar.
Prominent craniotomy defect is noted on the left. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the background EEG is low voltage
with rhythmic theta frequency activity of 6 Hz, reaching 50 to 60 microvolts followed by a lower
voltage more attenuated pattern. Intermittently there is some prominent increase in beta. Later
sections of the record are remarkable for occipitally predominant delta which is of different
frequencies, a little bit faster on the right compared to the left. There is some muscle and
movement artifact but as the movement artifact slows, there is a right frontocentral small
discrete sharp and more of a right parieto-occipital periodic sharp seen intermittently in the
record. These findings and this pattern differs substantially from the initial sections of the record.
They are also associated with richer overall background.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Pattern with generalized background slowing alternating with more of an irregular pattern
with posterior sharp waves or periodic delta.
2. Posterior periodic complexes or sharp waves.
3. Intermittent background attenuation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral dysfunction.
Of note, while the majority of this patient's trauma is on the left, it is likely that the seizures are
emanating from the right hemisphere given the clinical description of ictal left gaze deviation and
the epileptiform features reported.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is trached and has very slow periodic eye blinking.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a pattern with beta. There is somewhat periodic sharply contoured activities at T6-02, which is in the delta frequency range, but the periodic eye blink occurs approximately 5 seconds and does not seem to correlate with the epileptiform activity in the occipital region. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta frequency activity.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Right occipital periodic sharp waves.
3. Eye blinks which occur less than once per 5 seconds and do not correlate with epileptiform activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function affecting gray and white matter. The eye movement does not exactly correlate with EEG and maybe clinically evaluated.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is relatively
somnolent and seems to be posturing the right arm.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a theta
frequency pattern, which at times is more attenuated on the left compared to the right
There is a 6.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with some shifting arrhythmic delta activity
in the temporal regions. The patient Is awake and intermittently moving about. As the
recording continues, the most prominent area with attenuation of faster frequency
activity is the left temporal region.

HR: 84 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Superimposed slowing from the left hemisphere maximum in the temporal region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of
cerebral function, but with the greatest impact in the left temporal region.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient is relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is composed primarily of theta frequency activity with superimposed arrhythmic delta activity. The arrhythmic delta activity is more prominent in the right hemisphere with some sharply contoured activity in the right mid posterior temporal region. There is an amplitude asymmetry with higher amplitude activity on the right and some sharp waves on the right. The activity from the left is lower voltage and a little bit more uniform. As the patient drifts off to sleep, delta is identified on the left before the right.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Superimposed poor organization.
3. Amplitude asymmetry with higher amplitude activity on the right.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is intubated and unresponsive. There is prominent frontal delta present bilaterally but which is more prominent and more sharply contoured in the left frontal region. Ativan is administered and by 4:04, the EEG starts to show an improvement with more of a beta and theta frequency pattern. There is low voltage frontal delta, but the activity is abating and it is not as periodic or as high amplitude.
HR: 140 bpm
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. An initial pattern which is probably a late ictal pattern with rhythmic repetitive frontal delta bilaterally left-sided maximum.
2. Generalized background slowing at the end.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10 Hertz dominant rhythm. There are numerous epileptiform features in this record including focal, independent, right or temporal sharp waves, sharp waves that are maximum in A2 rather than at T1, T2 and other bursts that are frontally predominate spike wave activity as well as right greater than left frontal sharp waves. There are bursts of paroxysmal slowing noted in the record and a bit more arrhythmic delta from the right temporal region with the predominate right temporal sharp waves. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation does appear to elicit a driving response although the epileptiform activity continues through.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 1. Predominate epileptiform activity in nearly every 10 second particularly from the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings have been previously identified although the epileptiform activity is much more prominent on the right. This EEG supports a highly epileptogenic process in this individual who is currently seizure free. If the patient is thought to have funny spells of any type, additional testing may be of value.

MEDICATIONS: Lamictal, Vimpat.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is cooperative.
Photic stimulation is performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat
slow and disorganized. It is difficult to identify a posterior dominant rhythm and there is generous beta and theta. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background
slowing. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. There is a fair amount of
muscle artifact noted in the sleep record particularly in the frontal regions and the
muscle artifact persists into stage II sleep. In stage II sleep, in the transition in and out of sleep, there is a suggestion of a left parietal sharp wave.

HR: 70bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slow and disorganization.
2. Questionable left parietal sharp wave.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This individual has had many different patterns of
epileptiform activity. Overall, the epileptiform activity was markedly reduced today. If
epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study may be of value.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10?20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG is well organized. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record which produces some rhythmic slowing but it also produces rhythmic, sharply contoured, 3 Hz to 5 Hz activity from the left temporal region some of which has a well-defined left temporal sharp wave mixed in with it. The bursts of left temporal slowing are typically 3 to 5 seconds in duration, sometimes reaching 7 seconds. As the patient transitions into stage I sleep, there are a handful of left temporal sharp waves and just before photic stimulation, as she gets a little sleepier, there is a little bit more left posterior temporal slowing. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving with harmonic and supra harmonic driving.

HR: 72bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic left temporal mixed theta delta.
2. Rare left temporal sharp waves.
3. Occasional mid to posterior temporal focal slowing.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an unusual
pattern. In apparent wakefulness, the activity is a bit slow with a 9 Hz alpha rhythm and
some excess theta appearance. There are paroxysmal bursts of frontally predominant,
sharply contoured irregular delta. Some of the bursts are notched. In fact, there seems
to be a subtle sharp and slow wave complex in the right frontal region in this activity. As the recording continues and the patient is a bit more relaxed, the activity is seen In more prolonged bursts. In addition, there is some sharply contoured discharges from the left frontal region. Photic stimulation does not elicit a driving response and does not clearly alter this frontally predominant paroxysmal activity.

In addition, during photic stimulation the focal slowing and the left mid temporal sharp waves are apparent The patient starts to transition into stage II sleep during photic stimulation.

HR: 60 bpm with occasional PVCs.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1. Left anterior temporal sharp waves and rare spikes with complexes, maximum at T3/F7.
2. Rhythmic and arrhythmic left temporal focal delta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization related mechanism for epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an intrahemispheric asymmetry. The right hemisphere demonstrates a 9 Hz alpha rhythm in a background with excess beta and excess theta as well as a modest-degree of disorganization. The left hemisphere includes some defects perhaps due to the shape of the patient╒s skull, but arrhythmic delta activity is seen almost continuously in the left posterior temporal and central parietal region. This is particularly sharply contoured at C3 and P3. Features of drowsiness and include an increase in beta. The left parietal delta becomes higher amplitude and a more clearly defined P3 sharp wave is noted as the patient transitions into stage II sleep.
Hyperventilation accentuates the focal slowing. Photic stimulation is remarkable for artifacts in the T6 electrode but no significant driving response.
HR: 78bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing in the left central parietal region and posterior temporal region.
2. P3 sharp waves.
3. Slowing from the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The findings described above are congruent with a neurosurgical history. The generalized background slowing may be correlated with imaging and clinical events.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. The overall
background is a mixture of irregular theta and delta. There are posteriorly predominant sharp
waves, includes P5, and independently T6 02. There are bursts of faster frequency activity
which are picked up at the midline. The activity from the left frontal region is more or less
suppressed and there is more arrhythmic delta activity noted on the right. Tactile stimulation of
the patient seems to elicit a run of epileptiform activity. The epileptiform activity from the right
and left do not seem to be connected, but tactile stimulation seems to have produced
asynchronous train of sharp waves and spikes from either hemisphere, each of which have its
own periodicity. Additional spontaneous bursts of this epileptiform activity are noted. Again,
right occipital temporal and left occipital, again, without clear linkage between the 2 bursts.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Relative suppression of activity from the frontal regions.
2. Occipitally temporal predominant epileptiform activity.

epileptiform activity is generous posteriorly, not anteriorly. These findings may be
correlated with this patient's clinical exam and history. The possibility of subclinical seizures
should be considered in this individual.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. The patient is on supplemental nasal cannula oxygen and is responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG demonstrates an awake individual with a defined 7 to 9 hertz alpha rhythm. The alpha rhythm is easier to identify on the right compared to the left. There is also generous faster frequency activity noted in the occipital regions again a bit more than midline and transitioning toward the right central region. Arrhythmic delta activity is noted in the posterior regions. The activity from the frontal regions is low voltage and relatively suppressed. There are a handful of sharply contoured discharges particularly P3. Breach rhythm is noted with some double phase reversing artifact following the craniotomy and this is seen particularly in the left frontocentral region.

INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Seizure and spike detection software is used.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This long term 24 hour video EEG monitor demonstrates a slow background. The initial sections are primarily delta. As the recording continues, there is more theta frequency noted in the background with 1.5 hertz, 4.2 hertz activity and 6 hertz activity in the background. Stimulation of the patient produces an alerting response with an increase in muscle. Some sections of the record demonstrate medium amplitude FIRDA. Others demonstrate theta. Multiple clinical events are documented by the team. These include impaired mental status. Episodes of tremulousness are noted at 1:56 a.m. and 3:48 a.m. These are not associated with change in awareness. On a handful of occasions, an asymmetry is noted with a 6 hertz alpha rhythm identified on the left, not so clearly identified on the right
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
1. Markedly slow background.
2. Frontal intermittent and rhythmic delta activity.
3. On occasion, an asymmetric alpha rhythm, present only on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are compatible with a generalized disturbance of cerebral function. This is a nonspecific finding and can be seen in the toxic or metabolic encephalopathy as well as other causes. There are no epileptiform features noted. Although a Holter devise was not utilized, the patient has persistent tachycardia rather than intermittent paroxysmal tachycardia.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the background EEG is somewhat abnormal. There is excess theta. There are bursts of slowing. Right frontal temporal sharp waves are noted. There is also some shifting slowing. As the patient becomes drowsy, the asymmetry is a bit more remarkable with focal slowing in the right anterior temporal region and higher amplitude right anterior temporal spike and slow wave complexes. Bursts of sharp waves are noted as the patient transitions into sleep, which are seen first on the right and then on the left. The patient starts to transition into stage sleep. Sharp waves at that point are seen with an unusual field of spread, F8, T4, and then frontal left or right, or with an asymmetry, but with some bilateral representation. Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving response.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Abundant epileptiform activity with more than 1 localization.
2. Right anterior temporal sharp waves.
3. Sharply contoured delta from the left mid temporal region.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a marked asymmetry
between the 2 hemispheres. The right hemisphere demonstrates disruption of the alpha rhythm
with arrhythmic delta activity and high-amplitude right posterior temporal spikes and sharp
waves. Not all the sharp waves in the right hemisphere are identical. On some occasions,
there seems to be a positivity at C4 with a T6 phase reversal. The field is spread and overall
amplitude is somewhat variable. In addition, the amount of arrhythmic delta activity in the right
hemisphere is also variable. This high-amplitude spike demonstrates significant spread in a
referential montage and actually has picked up T6, 02, T 4, and even L1. On occasion, again
there is a positivity, either T4 or C4, depending on the montage employed and the delta is
throughout the right hemisphere. The left hemisphere is relatively well organized with a 9 Hz
posterior dominant rhythm. Features of drowsiness include accentuation of the epileptiform
activity and arrhythmic delta. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Nearly continuous focal slowing from the right hemisphere.
2. High amplitude right occipital and posterior temporal spiking.

has been seen in previous studies for this individual. This EEG demonstrates significant
epileptogenicity, even when she is well.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly slow.  Relatively low voltage.  It includes slow featureless delta and some more scant rhythmic theta with a few bursts of more paroxysmal rhythmic low voltage theta.  In addition, there is a periodic transient noted in the right posterior quadrant.  Sometimes this appears as a pled, other times as slow delta.  It starts at P4 and ends at O2.  It is sometimes spikier at O2 than it is at P2, but occurs first at P4.  As the recording continues, this abnormality is less prominent and appears as an infrequent, periodic delta burst. Stimulation of the patient clearly produces a reactivity with an increase in faster frequency activity.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing.
A slow, periodic complex in the right occipital or parietal region which improves over time.
Right posterior focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG demonstrates both positive and negative prognostic features for an individual 3 days post cardiac arrest.  In addition, it is not known when the patient had the seizure.  The overall pattern is one of some improvement in terms of the epileptiform activity over time suggesting that the seizure may have occurred today.  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as well as a focal disturbance in the right occipital region, but the presence of reactivity and variability are positive prognostic features after cardiac arrest.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background that, at best, reaches 6 Hz.  During the recording, there was noxious stimuli performed to the patient which would increase the frequency of the recording for about 2 to 3 seconds after stimuli.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen at P4 and T6 occasionally throughout the recording.  At times the field appears to be large and appears to spread somewhat to the posterior side to the left occipital region, but mainly all the sharp waves remain in that right posterior quadrant.
Generalized slow waves at 2 to 4 Hz, seen continuously throughout the recording.  In addition, there are episodes of diffuse attenuation seen while the patient is awake.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This patient had a clinical seizure during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The best organized EEG is at the end of the record with a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm in a symmetric background.
In the beginning of the EEG, there is a subtle asymmetry.  There seems to be a disruption of faster frequency activity in the right frontal region.  In addition, there is some sharply contoured activity in the left frontocentral region.  In this somewhat sharply contoured background, there seems to be a very subtle underlying sharp wave which can be seen at T3/T5 and C3.
A 10-second seizure is characterized by inability of the patient to respond.  That event occurs at 11:39:11.  It seems to begin with a burst of high amplitude 6.5 Hz activity which transitions to 3 Hz activity over 10 seconds.  Severe high amplitude discharge, but there seems to be a frontally predominant spike and wave discharge and interestingly, the focal features noted earlier on in the record disappear. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Myoclonus and rapidly progressive dementia, concern for seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while lethargic and confused.  Photic stimulation was performed and no hyperventilation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record to opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz, which is not seen consistently throughout the recording.  There is faster frequencies intermixed into a diffusely slow background of 2-4 Hz, that at times appears to be periodic in nature with frontally sharply contoured waves occurring at 2 Hz, which at times becomes more and more rhythmic.  In between this there is episodes of jerking with associated EMG artifact or muscle artifact in the EMG and only one appears to have a preceding anterior predominant sharp wave.  At times there is intermittent also anterior sharp waves.  No normal sleep is seen. Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:   As above.
SEIZURES:   None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing.
Periodic frontally dominant slowing intermixed with faster frequencies.
Frontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of a diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  However, the almost or pseudoperiodic pattern of the slowing, in addition to some jerks in clinical myoclonus could be consistent with a rapidly evolving neurogenic disease, like Creutzfeldt-Jakob.  Other causes cannot be excluded as the background at times appears to be faster and less suppressed than what would be expected in a late stage progressive dementia, like Creutzfeldt-Jakob.  Clinical correlation is recommended.

Hyperventilation accentuates the bursts of frontally predominant spike and slow wave activity.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is a more of a polyspike component to the bursts.
Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.  It does not accentuate the epileptiform activity.  The epileptiform activity does occur around the time of stimulation, but it also occurs even just prior to her following the stimulation.
HR:    96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Bursts of high amplitude frontally predominant 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These bursts are quite prominent.  None were longer than 2 seconds in duration and none were associated with impairment of awareness.  The
technologist did extensive testing of the patient to try and see if there would be a pause during the bursts, but she was not able to demonstrate any impairment of awareness.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video  EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal, single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 9 Hz which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is an increased amount of beta frequency seen diffusely throughout the recording.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 and F8/T4 independently throughout the recording at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts.  At times, there are some sharply contoured waveforms in the left temporal region which are more consistent with wickets, not clearly epileptiform.
At times during wakefulness, there appears to be excessive theta seen throughout the recording at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background, however, there are short episodes of wakefulness where for very short periods there appears to be a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz that appears somewhat reactive to eye opening.  Otherwise, the patient, even while awake there appears to be some diffuse slowing and quickly drowses off to stage 1/stage 2 sleep.  There is some normal frontocentral beta seen in the short wakeful state.  Photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts which is seen almost continuously throughout the recording and then quickly the patient goes into sleep.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm reaching 50-60 mV.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta. In relaxed wakefulness, as well as in the transition into early drowsiness, and more remarkably in hyperventilation, there are bursts of frontally predominant 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity.  In relaxed wakefulness, bursts are less than 2.5 seconds in duration, but they are bit more prominent in hyperventilation.  Hyperventilation also produces bursts of rhythmic frontal delta.  During photic stimulation, there are some bursts of more posteriorly predominant delta, some of which are sharply contoured, but without a definitive posterior spike and wave complex.  Head rocking artifact is also noted in photic stimulation.  Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved, but there are brief sections, just very brief epochs, but the patient seems to start to fall asleep with some vertex activity, but sleep is not sustained.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is a small amount of background theta. Right frontal sharp waves are noted.  The sharp waves and some right frontal rhythmic slowing is accentuated by hyperventilation.
As the patient transitions to drowsiness, right frontal sharp waves are noted with a rhythmic delta activity in the right temporal region. As the patient transitions in and out of sleep, the right frontal sharp waves identified are typically maximum at F4 with variable spread to FP2 or F8.  The amplitude of the spike can exceed 70 mV.  Some of the spikes have significant spread towards the midline at FZ.  The epileptiform activity is accentuated in sleep.  The patient transitions into sleep during photic stimulation.  Despite this, a driving response is elicited.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right frontal sharp waves typically maximum at F4, but with variable spread.
Focal slowing in the right frontal region.  This is maximum in the frontal regions in wakefulness, but spread to the temporal regions in sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are similar to previous EEGs.  They may have been accentuated somewhat by the sleep deprivation required to obtain this EEG for a patient who lives a long distance away.  The overall characteristics of this patient's epileptiform activity is essentially unchanged.  An EKG may be warranted to assess the patient's bradycardia.

HR:    66 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  This EEG supports a relatively severe disturbance of cerebral function but is not specific as to etiology.  These findings could be seen in a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.  They may also be seen following anoxic insult.  The patient's baseline significant cognitive
function with associated impact on cerebral pattern may also play a role in the findings described above.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was  performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely slow.  Much of the time there is a rhythmic theta pattern with a 6 Hz background and a 6-7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  There is a slight asymmetry with a bit more arrhythmic slowing in the right hemisphere in comparison to the left, but at times the left does have some occasional bursts of slowing.  The patient quickly transitions in and out of stage I and stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles.  Sleep is relatively low voltage. Photic stimulation is performed as the patient is drifting to sleep and does not activate the record.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized, rhythmic background slowing.
Superimposed focal slowing on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to previous studies, 1 year ago, this EEG demonstrates an overall improvement of the background.  There were no epileptiform features.  The focal slowing on the right is congruent with a history of previous stroke.

She had a tonic-clonic seizure and then developed absence seizures, treated with ethosuximide.  The patient stopped taking her medications in January 2012 because of GI upset.  The patient reports that she has seizures only when she is exercising heavily such as running or undergoing mental concentration.  She does not describe a lapse of attention but is aware of a lightheaded feeling.  She recalls that this lightheaded feeling was identical to the feeling that she had when she suffered more active absence seizures.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements followed by generous vertex wave spindles and posts.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving. Notable in this record is the hyperventilation response.  There are bursts of rhythmic high-amplitude delta.  A handful of these are notched.  Overall, however, there is a very generous hyperventilation response and clearly identifying spike and wave activity from the background is somewhat difficult.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Underlying spike and wave activity underneath the hyperventilation response.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Spike and wave activity was not identified at any other time other than hyperventilation, congruent with this the patient's clinical history of only experiencing symptoms under similar conditions.  Comparison with childhood EEGs would be of help.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and no activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Multi-electrode artifact due to continuous movement and muscle artifact seen in all electrodes throughout the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals at best a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 6-7 Hz.  There is some minimal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen in the right anterior temporal region and left anterior temporal region independently, slightly more pronounced over the left.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing and independent bilateral (left more than right) anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This very limited EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction as well as independent bilateral anterior temporal (left more than right) focal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures were clearly seen.  Please note that this was a poor quality EEG due to agitation of the patient and no clear definitive statements can be made, however, a repeat EEG with deeper sedation may aid in clarifying or confirming a diagnosis if clinically desired.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  In hyperventilation, subtle underlying asymmetry is noted with a bit of underlying slowing in the left hemisphere, particularly the temporal region.  Intermittent, left focal slowing is noted also on occasion in wakefulness and in the transition to drowsiness.  The slowing may be isolated theta, rare deltas, or even slowing of the faster frequency activity on the left. The patient drifts into deeper stages of sleep, but sleep is not sustained. Photic stimulation elicits a subtle driving response.  The patient is drifting off into sleep during photic stimulation.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 56-year-old man with a past medical history of a left craniotomy for aneurysms and stroke, who now presents with episodes of left arm numbness followed by twitching that lasts approximately 5 minutes with onset about 2 to 3 months ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Gabapentin.
INTRODUCTION:  Activation procedure of hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  EEG was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and single EKG leads.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 9-10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  During drowsiness increase in the amount of theta and vertex waves are evident.  Sleep architecture is more prominent over the left hemisphere.  Occasional bursts of delta and theta activity are captured over the left hemisphere.  Additional faster frequencies over the left central occipital region captured consistent with breach artifact.  Hyperventilation increases the amount of slowing observed over the left hemisphere.  Photic stimulation results in appropriate occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  No epileptiform discharges are captured.  Heart rate less than 60 beats a minute is occasionally observed in a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Occasional mild left hemispheric slowing.
Breach primarily over the left central occipital region.
Asymmetry of sleep architecture with sleep architecture better formed over the left hemisphere.
No stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.

If a clinical suspicion of epilepsy still persists a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This is a low voltage EEG in a patient who is quite sleepy, transitioning in and out of stage 2 sleep.  There is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  This low voltage EEG is best reviewed at 3 Hz.  There is rhythmic theta and even some delta noted in the right hemisphere.  Stage 2 sleep is relatively symmetric with vertex waves, K complexes and spindles.  As the patient transitions in and out of sleep, mu activity is noted in wakefulness.  As stage 2 sleep continues, shifting slowing is later noted in stage 2 sleep with a single sharp wave in the left hemisphere in stage 2 sleep.
Photic stimulation does active the record.  Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a challenging, but abnormal EEG due to SHIFTING slowing at times with more rhythmic slowing from the right hemisphere, but occasionally in stage 2 sleep from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Only a single sharp wave was identified from the left which therefore must be considered an artifact.  These findings may be correlated with imaging.  Focal slowing was noted, but unfortunately there was only a single sharp wave.  If additional information is needed for this individual with frequent seizures, inpatient or outpatient video EEG monitoring may be valuable.  The focal slowing on the right fits with a history of the right MCA infarct.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record is mainly in sleep, however, during limited wakefulness, a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is seen over both the right and left hemisphere is slightly higher on the right.  There is also frontocentral beta slightly less prominent over the left hemisphere compared to the right.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness, stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.  Please note that stage 1 vertex waves were noted to be asymmetrical and at times seen more prominently over the left than the right.  However, this only occurs in sleep which suggested these are vertex waves rather than epileptiform discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Paucity of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere compared to the right and some slowing in the left frontal region.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left frontal F3 slowing as well as paucity of faster frequencies.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left frontal region, which may have a correlation with a lesion in that region.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.

DIAGNOSIS:  Rule out seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 55-year-old female with prior EEG and presents with history of diabetes, hypertension, anemia, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, bypass surgery.
MEDICATIONS:  Patient is taking medications for diabetes and high blood pressure.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the lab using the standard International 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to one channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation was not performed and photic stimulation was performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness and stage I and II sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, alpha rhythm is 8-8.5 Hz in frequency, 30-50 microvolts in amplitude seen in occipital region which attenuates with eye opening.  There is 6-7 Hz diffuse theta activity seen during wakefulness which is distributed symmetrically.  There was a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity which is distributed symmetrically.  A stage I and stage II sleep is characterized with disappearance of alpha rhythm, slowing of the background activity, and absence of motion and eye-blink artifact as well as presence of the vertex sharp waves, sleep spindles, and K complexes.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple frequencies and did not resolve in a driving response.  Heart rate was 60-70 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is mildly abnormal EEG due to excess theta activity during wakefulness.  There was no epileptiform discharge or seizure activity noted during this recording.  The above finding could be due to metabolic, toxic, hypoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to effect of sedating medication, bilateral cerebral dysfunction, degenerative brain disease.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were captured or recorded.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  Sections of the record include a rhythmic approximately 7 Hz theta frequency background with a 7-8 Hz alpha rhythm, but much of the record include significantly more slower rhythmic mixed theta and delta.  Superimposed upon this is some focal slowing with a bit more arrhythmic alpha on the left compared to the right and disruption of faster frequency activity.  In addition, occasional sharp waves are noted independently at T4, P4 and T1.  Sharp waves are relatively infrequent.  Stimulation of the patient produces an alerting response with an increase in the faster frequency activity.  Rare triphasic waves were observed.  Heart rate 97 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Intermittent, paroxysmal slowing.
Superimposed asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency activity on the left in comparison to the right.
Independent sharp waves seen from either hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting gray and white matter.  In addition, a structural or functional process on the left should be considered.  There are infrequent sharp waves seen from either hemisphere.  These findings may even be correlated with imaging and clinical history.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 46-year-old woman with past medical history of seizures, right hemispheric stroke, hepatitis C, who presents with a possible seizure.  As per history, patient had an episode characterized by left upper extremity shaking that lasted a few minutes.  This is the second such episode since August of 2012.  Patient stopped taking Keppra about 2 days ago.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, metformin, Coumadin, insulin, Zocor.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is right to left interhemispheric asymmetry with slow waveforms over the right hemisphere.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the left hemisphere consists of a well formed and modulated 9 to 10 Hertz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  Over the left hemisphere, there is preserved anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the right hemisphere is unstable and reaches about 9 Hertz alpha.  There is no clear anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background over the right hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity with under-riding faster frequencies.  Slowing is more pronounced over the anterior temporal/frontal region.  The patient briefly falls asleep by the end of the recording.  Sleep spindles are captured only over the left hemisphere.  Brief 1 to 3-second bursts of frontally predominant rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) are captured.  Occasional poorly formed, sharply contoured waveforms observed over the right midtemporal region with phase reversal over T4-T6 electrode.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in occipital driving only over the left hemisphere.
FINDINGS:
Continuous moderate slowing over the right hemisphere, most pronounced over the anterior temporal/frontal region.
Sharp waves over the right mid temporal region.
No electrographic seizures.
Asymmetry of sleep architecture with sleep better formed over the left hemisphere.
Asymmetrical occipital driving with driving only observed over the left hemisphere.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 23-minute awake and briefly asleep EEG, due to continuous focal slowing over the right hemisphere that is most pronounced over the frontotemporal region and occasional epileptiform discharges over the right mid midtemporal region. These findings indicate focal cerebral dysfunction that carries increased epileptogenic potential. FIRDA is observed in encephalopathies, increase intracranial pressure, deep white matter lesions. No electrographic seizures are captured.

Date of study is December 14.  CAT scan shows chronic ischemic cerebrovascular disease.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Ativan, Versed, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the emergency room using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was somnolent, but sometimes responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly slow.  Superimposed upon the slow background there are sharp waves, some periodic slowing and some periodic sharps noted in the left  hemisphere typically at T1, but with some variability, T1, F7 and T3.  Stimulation of the patient does produce an alerting response with a glimpse of an alpha on the right, but the patient remains somnolent.  Unfortunately, stimulation of the patient also produces a fair amount of artifact.  In an averaged reference, the epileptiform activity is maximum at F7 with a variable field in the left anterior temporal or frontotemporal.
Heart rate 84 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing from the left frontotemporal region.
Sharp waves, periodic complexes and periodic delta in the left frontal and frontotemporal region with variability.
Background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  As the recording continues, with stimulation of the patient there is an increase in faster frequency activity on the right.  However, the periodic activity and the sharp waves on the left have not abated, although there are no clinical seizures.  Ongoing clinical evaluation is warranted.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 48-year-old female who was admitted for change in mental status.  On arrival, she was found to be aphasic.  She was confused, but responsive to her name.  Past medical history is significant for dilated cardiomyopathy, status post AICD and LVAD, LV thrombosis on Coumadin, atrial fibrillation, left MCA stroke, and peripheral neuropathy.
MEDICATIONS:  The patient's medications include Plavix, warfarin, ceftazidime, simvastatin, Ambien, Coreg, lorazepam, midazolam, and Topamax.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed at bedside using the standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to 1-channel of EKG monitoring.  This tracing captures patient in an obtunded stuporous state. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the stuporous state, the background activity was characterized by diffuse slowing consisting of sharply contoured delta wave slower on the left side with a frequency of 3-3.5 Hz high amplitude with sharp wave activities most prominent in the left central parietal and occipital regions There were also Triphasic waves seen intermittently with an Anterior- posterior gradient/ occurring with a frequency of 1-1.2 Hz.  Heart rate was 90 to 100 beats per minute.  Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were not performed.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to diffuse slowing with sharply contoured delta waves, and Triphasic waves and sharp wave discharges most pronounced in left posterior quadrant without evolution.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Slowing of background activity and Triphasic waves are indicative of metabolic, toxic, hypoxic or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively it could be due to the effects of sedating medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction.  The presence of sharp wave discharges are indicative of hyperexcitability of cerebral cortex that places this patient at risk for partial seizures.  Clinical correlation is recommended.

CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with position of additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient is a 65-year-old man with history of cardiac rest status post prolonged CPR now with diffuse myoclonus concerning for status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS:  Valproic acid, lorazepam and 4 mg vecuronium given during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient, Until approximately 10 minutes into the recording the EEG consists of high amplitude diffuse irregular EMG artifact with frequent brief periods of discontinuity.
At approximately 8 minutes into the recording, 4 mg of vecuronium is administered.  Approximately 10 minutes into the recording, EMG artifact disappears.  Once EMG artifact is cleared, the background consists of low to moderate amplitude, generalized frontally predominant, spikes and poly spikes with after-going slow waves that occur at approximately 1.5 to 4 Hz.  These discharges appear both rhythmically and semi-rhythmically.  They do not organize into clear electrographic seizures.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
FINDINGS: 1.  Frontally predominant generalized 1.5 to 4 Hz G-PEDs and quasi PEDs.
2. No clear electrographic Seizures.

No clear electrographic seizures are captured.  This electroencephalogram pattern indicates high cortical irritability, high risk for status epilepticus and in post anoxic brain injury indicates a poor chance for full neurological recovery.

MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, heparin, Protonix.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized.  There is a 10.7-Hz alpha rhythm.  There is focal slowing noted in the right mid-to-posterior temporal region.  Hyperventilation was performed with good effort, producing rhythmic, high-amplitude slowing.  There were rare bursts of paroxysmal slowing, but no definitive 3-Hz spike and wave slowing noted with hyperventilation.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in rhythmicity of the background.  The focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant was less prominent as the patient became drowsy.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response with some lambda as well.  There was a suggestion of a photoparoxysmal response with the 11-Hz stimulation and very subtle spike and wave activity elicited bilaterally with 15-Hz stimulation.  These were discrete bursts of 5-Hz spike and wave activity at 15 and then some paroxysmal changes again at 17 Hz stimuli with spike and wave activity.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
Discrete 3- to 5-Hz spike and wave activity noted with photic stimulation at faster flash frequencies.
Focal slowing noted from the right mid-to-posterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The spike and wave activity has been noted in this patient's many previous EEGs.  Compared to previous studies, this EEG seems to have a little less in the way of spike and wave activity.  The focal slowing is congruent with the recent strip.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  Technically, a significant head rocking artifact was noted, particularly in the right occipital region.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a high amplitude 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Minimal drowsiness is characterized by a decrease of eye movement and anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.
Hyperventilation generates a vigorous hyperventilation response with bursts of rhythmic high amplitude rhythmic mixed beta delta.  In addition, there is frontally predominant underlying 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity noted in brief bursts and a little bit of irregularity in the posterior regions.  A handful of the bursts of paroxysmal slowing are posteriorly predominant.
Photic stimulation also elicited rare spike and wave activity which was frontally predominant and a single burst was noted as the patient became drowsy following photic stimulation towards the end of the record.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Three to 5 Hz spike and wave activity.
Occasional occipitally predominant slowing noted in hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are similar to previous EEGs and support a generalized mechanism for epilepsy.  As has been seen in previous studies, this EEG may be compatible with a primary secondarily generalized mechanism for seizures.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab  using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed, but hyperventilation was not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The awake EEG is quite abnormal.  The right hemisphere is nearly normal with a 9 Hz alpha rhythm and a pattern with generous beta.  The left hemisphere has a continuous, periodic complete with a generous field of spread throughout the left hemisphere, but maximum in the left mid to posterior temporal region.  This also has significant involvement in the left parietal and occipital region.  Using an average reference, this activity is nearly maximum at O1 with a phase reversal at P3.  The phase reverses at P3-C3.  Features of drowsiness including increase in beta is noted throughout the right hemisphere, less so on the left.  Photic stimulation does not activate the record.  Heart rate is 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
A complex, epileptiform discharge in the left hemisphere with some variability and even a polyphasic component.  This discharge may begin in the left frontocentral region, but its highest amplitude is in the left occipital region with a generous field of spread in the left posterior quadrant.
This is essentially a periodic complex without frequency evolution.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.
Despite the eye movement artifacts, as the patient transitions into drowsiness, there is occasional, focal slowing with beta noted in the left hemisphere, particularly frontotemporal frontocentral.
Photic stimulation elicited brief bilateral driving.
Heart rate 60 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to focal slowing noted in drowsiness in the left frontocentral frontotemporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The findings described above are of unclear clinical significance.  They may be seen in the context of TIA or cerebrovascular ischemia.  No definitive epileptiform features were identified.  Because similar features can be seen in the context of a focal seizure, if needed, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In apparent wakefulness, the overall background EEG is somewhat slow with rhythmic theta and delta.  It is difficult to define this alpha rhythm in an otherwise low voltage EEG.  Generous frontal central beta activity was noted.
Hyperventilation produced prominent rhythmic bilateral 3-4 Hz activity.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.  In addition, the bursts of slowing were a bit more prominent on the left, some of which were sharply contoured, but without definitive sharp waves.
Heart rate:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing noted intermittently in wakefulness.
Scant alpha rhythm (this is not considered necessarily pathological).
Background disorganization.
Superimposed focal slowing more so from the left frontal temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to a previous EEG, 01/07/2013, the focal slowing does not appear to be so prominent, but there may be more generalized background slowing.  The previous EEG was primarily in sleep. Consideration for both a focal and a diffuse disturbance of cerebral dysfunction is appropriate.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This was an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is a fair amount of muscle artifact noted in the background and there is a slight degree of disorganization in both hemispheres.  The most prominent features in this record include intermittent focal slowing in the right hemisphere with spread to the midline with bursts of higher amplitude, right frontocentral delta.  In the context of a breech rhythm, there is some sharply contoured discharges at F4, but without after going slow wave.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response somewhat more apparent on the left than the right, but present bilaterally.
Features of sleep included the appearance of frontal delta, right more so than the left.  Brief stage I sleep with vertex waves was noted, but stage II sleep was not sustained.  Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent, focal slowing noted in the right hemisphere most prominent in drowsiness or sleep with a generous field of spread into the right hemisphere and to the midline.
Disruption of faster frequency activity in the right frontocentral region.
Mild slowing and disorganization on the left.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is prominent, frontal central beta.  In wakefulness an a bit more prominently in drowsiness, there is focal slowing from the right frontal central and central temporal regions.  This is primarily characterized by slower delta, but with some disruption in faster frequency activity.  Hyperventilation was performed early in the record, and accentuates the right frontal central focal slowing.  Features of drowsiness included increase in beta.  The intermittent right frontal central focal slowing persists.
Photic stimulation elicited harmonic and super harmonic driving.
Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to focal slowing from the right frontal central region with occasional disruption of frequency activity in that area.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is most supportive of a structural or functional process in the right frontal central region.  No epileptiform features were identified.  As this patient recovers from the head injury, a follow-up study may be of value.

ARTIFACTS:  None.
MEDICATIONS:  Cannot remember medications.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  Patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures include hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient was recorded in wakeful and stage I and stage II of sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation which produced no abnormal discharge, however, during photic stimulation there was event which I will describe in the next section.  Stage I and stage II sleep were seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow wave seen intermittently at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
EPISODES:  During photic stimulation, specifically at 11 Hz, the patient all of the sudden starting shaking her head side to side followed by generalized shaking in an irregular fashion of her whole body while she had her eyes closed.  This continued to occur for about 3 minutes, at which point the patient stopped and appeared to be tired.  During the recording there was a lot of diffuse artifact, however, in between the shaking normal posterior dominant rhythm can be seen and no epileptiform correlate was seen during the episode.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to left mid temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left mid temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  The episode described above had no EEG correlate and is consistent with the diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic event.  No seizures or actual epileptiform discharges were seen.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is 7 Hz alpha rhythm in a pattern with generous beta.  In apparent wakefulness, intermittent rhythmic theta was noted.  In addition to this theta, there are intermittent burst of somewhat irregular slowing noted bilaterally.
The patient transitioned in and out of sleep with vertex waves in snore arousals.
Photic stimulation was performed as the patient was drifting off to sleep and did produce a driving response at faster flash frequencies.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Some unusual bursts of shifting slowing in sleep particularly in the central regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATIONS:  This patient seems to awaken frequently from sleep or has a fair amount of muscle artifact in sleep.  A more prolonged sleep record maybe helpful to search for epileptiform activity in this middle-aged adult with Down syndrome.  There are no previous EEGs available for comparison in term of the slow alpha rhythm for an adult of this age.

The patient has a trochlear implant and he has a skull defect on the right side.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In a lethargic state, the background activity is characterized by a generalized slowing in the delta and theta-frequency range. There is hemispheric asymmetry characterized by attenuation and slowing in right cerebral hemisphere. There is a excess theta activity well formed in left cerebral hemisphere.  There are intermittent delta activity, beta seen with a frequency of 1 to 1.2 Hz lasting for 2-3 seconds.  There are intermittent sharp waves arising from the left parietal-occipital regions most pronounced in P3 with field spread to C3 and O1, occasionally intermixed with the burst of left parieto-temporal slowing.  Heart rate was 70 to 80 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Diffuse slowing of the background activity.
Presence of theta burst.
Attenuation of the background activity in the right cerebral hemisphere.
Left parieto-occipital sharp wave discharges with no evolution, intermixed with temporoparietal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Diffuse slowing of the background activity could be due to toxic, metabolic, hypoxic, infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to sedating medications or cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  The theta burst could also be due to increased intracranial pressure, metabolic encephalopathy, or deep midline lesions in the brain.  Right hemispheric attenuation of the background could be due to right subdural hematoma.  The presence of intermittent sharp wave discharges in the left parieto-occipital region is suggestive of underlying epileptogenicity of that region and place this patient at higher risk for partial seizures.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the record opens, there is a symmetric 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm that is of medium amplitude and is reactive to eye opening.  There was a small amount of frontocentral beta activity that is symmetrically distributed over the frontocentral regions bilaterally.  Throughout the recording, there is intermittent focal slowing noted over the left hemisphere.  This is maximal in the frontotemporal and frontocentral regions.  This is characterized by brief epochs of 5 to 6 Hz theta activity and rare very brief epochs of 2 to 3 Hz low amplitude delta activity.  When this is seen, it does disrupt the integrity of the posterior dominant rhythm on the left.  In addition to the focal slowing, there are sharp transient waves identified over the left frontal region.  These are not frankly epileptiform but are suggestive potentially of actual sharp waves.  There are no electrographic seizures detected and there were no clinical events denoted by the patient.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and did not induce a significant photic driving response.  The heart rate was between 60 and 90 beats during the recording.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG capturing wakefulness through drowsiness due to the presence of focal slowing over the left frontotemporal and frontocentral regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The presence of focal slowing may suggest a structural brain lesion in the left hemisphere.  Sharp transient waves are not frankly epileptiform but may be suggestive of an epileptiform discharge over the left hemisphere.  Clinical correlation is suggested.

Abnormal discharges:
Focal slow waves seen over the right hemisphere, maximal at F8/T4 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
There is also intermittent left frontal at F3 focal slowing and at times seen in rhythmic discharges over the frontal hemisphere where it becomes sharply contoured.
Generalized slow waves at 5 to 7 Hz seen throughout the recording in wakefulness.
Heart rate:  72.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to continuous right hemispheric focal slowing maximal in the anterior temporal region, in addition to independent left frontal focal slowing and generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction over the right hemisphere, maximal in the right anterior temporal region, which is consistent with the known brain lesion, in addition to some left frontal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  There is also evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.

The patient was admitted with a change in mental status.  She had a seizure on the 9th lasting 45 seconds and then another event today, question encephalopathy, question postictal, question behavior.
MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, heparin, Keppra, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient had been sedated, had a recent seizure and was quite somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The initial sections of the EEG demonstrate a low voltage slow pattern with slow delta.  With stimulation, a scant 8 Hz alpha rhythm was noted.  The technologist was able to awaken the patient for hyperventilation which seems to produce some rhythmic, sharply contoured slowing in the right hemisphere, particularly in the right mid to anterior temporal region.  As the patient becomes drowsy bursts of high amplitude frontal delta were noted.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record.  Heart rate 78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Abnormal background with a low voltage slow pattern.
Excess theta.
Rhythmic right delta particularly in the right mid temporal region notable with hyperventilation.
FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG demonstrates a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function which may be due to a postictal state or medications.  In addition, there are focal features with rhythmic, sharply contoured slowing in the right temporal region.  Based on these findings, EEG monitoring was requested.

Recurrent seizures in sleep with an event with foaming at the mouth and unresponsiveness. A total of 3 nocturnal seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
This is an awake and asleep record in a very drowsy patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is in stage 2 sleep with vertex waves and spindles.  With stimulation as the patient awakens from sleep, brief, frontal polyspike complexes were observed.  This was followed by a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm and then new activity of 10 Hz although testing was not performed to confirm the presence of new.
Hyperventilation was performed after this which did not produce an alerting response.  Following hyperventilation, the patient drifted back into stage 2 sleep with vertex wave, K-complexes, spindles and posts.
Photic stimulation was remarkable for photoelectric artifact.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a subtly abnormal EEG due to rare, frontally predominant polyspike activity which was elicited when the patient was awakened from stage 2 sleep.  This activity is approximately 6.5 Hz.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Although the epileptiform activity described above is subtle and is seen in a record with frontal muscle artifact, there is a clear frontal 6.5 Hz spike and wave or polyspike and wave discharge noted in the arousal from sleep.  This seems to be frontally predominant and bilaterally symmetric and more compatible with a generalized mechanism for epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EEG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  During the last 2 minutes of the recording there is multiple electrode artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which can only be seen over the right hemisphere.  There is an absence of normal beta over the left hemisphere.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
Abnormal discharges:  Focal slow waves seen continuously over the right hemisphere, maximal at F7/T3.  There is associated loss of faster frequencies over this region.  There is also some attenuation.  This is seen continuously at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
Seizures:  None.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra, and the patient received 8 mg of Ativan a few hours before the recording.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and one channel EKG.  The long-term record was reviewed for abnormalities and clinical events.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Interictal EEG:  The recording from 04/15/2013 to 04/16/2013 was characterized by diffuse slowing.  There was also continuous polymorphic slowing at T3 in the 4-5 Hz range intermixed with 2-3 Hz frequency, which was frequently sharply contoured.  Occasional sharp waves were noted at T3.
From 10 p.m. onwards, the amount of sharp waves had significantly decreased. Towards the end of the recording, no sharp waves were seen.
Ictal Events:  There was one push button at 8:51 p.m., during which time clinically the patient was moving around.
Ictal EEG:  There was no EEG correlate to the push button event at 8:51 p.m.
Some sleep element characterized by sleep spindles were noted, but there was no definite sleep architecture recorded.
IMPRESSION:  This long-term EEG recording is abnormal due to:
Diffuse bilateral slowing.
Focal left T3 continuous polymorphic slowing in the theta and delta range sharply contoured.
Sharp waves at T3 without evolution.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
The generalized slowing is suggestive of a diffuse process, such as toxic metabolic process versus medication induced versus a postictal state.
Left focal slowing, which is continuous and most pronounced in the left frontocentral and mid temporal regions is suggestive of an underlying structural abnormality, which is consistent with a known stroke in that region.
The left temporal sharps are consistent with epileptogenicity at T3 that places this patient at high risk of localization-related epilepsy.  Clinical correlation is recommended.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred but  photic stimulation was completed.  This was an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an asymmetry.  The alpha rhythm on the left is a little higher amplitude than the right but the alpha on the right is a little faster, 7.3 on the right, 6.8 on the left.  This EEG demonstrates some asymmetric eye movement but it also demonstrates intermittent rhythmic slowing from the left.  In relaxed wakefulness SREDA was noted.  With stimulation of the patient there is an alerting and this rhythmic central theta disappeared.  It was not seen again as the patient transitioned into stage I sleep with vertex waves.  Stage I sleep was not sustained.
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
An asymmetry with slower alpha on the left compared to the right.
Intermittent rhythmic slowing on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  The focal slowing and the disrupted alpha rhythm on the left are anticipated findings following a stroke.  Of note, this background is slower than was noted in 2011.  In addition, SREDA is considered a normal finding although it is a rare entity in a subject of this age.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the lab using standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was not performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through drowsiness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 6.5 to 7 Hz well formed on the right side in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity.  The background activity is characterized by diffuse slowing consisting of 5-6 Hz theta activity intermixed with 3 to 3.5 Hz delta activity.  There is intermittent left posterior quadrant slowing in theta and delta frequencies with loss of faster frequencies and attenuation.  This activity was associated with occasional spikes and spike-and-wave complexes with no evolution.  There were also triphasic waves seen intermittently with an anterior-posterior gradient with a frequency of 1.5 Hz, occasionally well formed on the right side.  The background is intermixed with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges seen in the left posterior quadrant lasting for 1 to 1-1/2 minute with no evolution or behavioral changes.  Heart rate was 60 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing the patient in a wakefulness and drowsiness due to,
Disorganized and slow background activity in theta and delta range.
Left posterior quadrant slowing with loss of faster frequencies and attenuations.
Left posterior quadrant occasional spikes and spike-and-wave complexes with no evolutions.
Presence of triphasic waves.
Left posterior quadrant PLEDs maximal at T5 with no behavioral changes or evolutions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The diffuse slowing and triphasic waves are suggestive of either metabolic, toxic, anoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunctions.  Left focal slowing with loss of faster frequencies and attenuation is consistent with a history of left MCA stroke. Occasional spikes in left posterior region are suggestive of underlying epileptogenicity. PLEDs suggest underlying cortical irritability due to an underlying structural lesion such as stroke, tumor, or infection predisposing to epileptic seizures. These PLEDs did not evolve in seizures. This does not rule out intermittent seizures.  Clinical correlation is recommended.

INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system of with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed, since the patient is 8 months' pregnant.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 11.5-12 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eye opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies of low amplitude anteriorly.  During sleep, symmetrical vertex wave and sleep spindles are captured.  Intermittent frequently arrhythmic beta activity is captured over the left posterior quadrant.  Additionally, intermittent low to moderate amplitude sharp waves with after-going slow waves are observed over the left posterior quadrant, with phase reversal over T5, O1, P3, C3 electrodes.  Frequency of these discharges increases during sleep.  At times, they are imbedded within the rhythmic alpha range monomorphic activity.  On a single occasion, at approximately 3:01:50 p.m., a rhythmic burst in alpha range is noted over the left anterior temporal/frontal region.

CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single lead EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  There is no clear posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta.  Additional moderate amplitude frontally predominant intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) is observed.  During sleep the degree of slowing increases, occasionally.  The discontinuity is observed, and the sleep spindles are noted.  There is paucity of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere.  Four seizures were observed.  The seizures occurred at 12:23:01 p.m., 12:26 p.m., 12:45:18 p.m., and 12:48:23 p.m.  The longest seizure duration was approximately 80 seconds.  The seizures start with lower amplitude fast activity over the left  occipital region.  This activity rapidly increases in amplitude and becomes more sharply contoured and rhythmic.  As seizure evolves additional rhythmic sharply contoured delta activity is observed over the left frontal central region with significant reflection over the rest of the brain.  As the seizure progresses left occipital activity decreases in frequency and increases in amplitude.  Clinically, the patient is unable to answer questions or follow commands during the seizure.  He repeatedly repeats the word ""yeah"" when asked to follow commands or answer questions.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation does not result in additional abnormalities.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Moderate focal left hemispheric slowing.
Electrographic seizures, left occipital onset, up to 80 seconds in duration, occurring in clusters of 2.
FIRDA.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 42 minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing that is more pronounced over the left hemisphere, and 4 focal electrographic seizures of left occipital onset.  Diffuse slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal left hemispheric slowing and focal left occipital onset seizures indicate focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, and is consistent with the patient's history of a left hemispheric stroke.  FIRDA could be seen in encephalopathy, increased intracranial pressure and white matter lesions.  These findings were conveyed to the Neurology Team at the time of the review.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 59-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, multiple lacunar infarcts, chronic small-vessel disease, noncompliant on medications, comes with a chief complaint of status epilepticus.
TECHNICAL:  Difficulties none.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 6 Hz which appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta during wakefulness.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and sleep and easily goes into sleep.  During the recording, specifically as the patient goes to sleep, there appears to be small sharply contoured discharges seen at T3 and at T4 most consistent with benign epileptiform transient of sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Mild generalized slowing at 5-7 Hz seen continuously during withdrawal wakefulness throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:
None.
HEART RATE:  102.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Again please note that benign epileptiform  sharp transients (BETS) were seen in this recording.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 60-year-old woman with a past medical history of an AVM, status post surgeries and strokes with seizures.  She has been seizure free for years, but has had some intermittent feelings of off balance within the month of June.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that is best seen over the left hemisphere and reaches 9 Hz.  There is normal frontal central beta seen over the left hemisphere only.  Over the right hemisphere the posterior dominant rhythm is disrupted and the frontal central beta is accentuated and a large area of amplitude consistent with a breach, which I will describe in the abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal sharp waves seen frequently at F8/T4 and independently at T4 in wakefulness and sleep.
Focal sharp waves seen also at F7/T3 and at T3, but only occasionally.  These are also seen in wakefulness and sleep.
Continuous focal slowing seen over T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV with an associated increasing faster frequency in amplitude consistent with a breach rhythm.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate:  66.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to independent right anterior temporal and mid temporal sharp waves, as well as left mid temporal and anterior temporal sharp waves.  In addition, there is evidence of focal structural dysfunction and irritability over the right mid temporal region which is consistent with a known AVM and surgery.  No seizures were seen.

She had left arm and leg twitching.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, COPD.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, morphine, Seroquel and valproic acid.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation or photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  No clear posterior dominant rhythm was seen.  In the lethargic state there was diffuse slowing of the background consisting of 5-6 Hz theta activity intermixed with 2-3 Hz delta activity.  These activities are intermixed with occasional beta activity with frontocentral distribution.  There was occasional eye movement artifact noted.  There is a spontaneous variability seen with increase in background frequency intermittently.  There is also some reactivity seen in the form of increased background frequency on stimulating the patient.  There is no epileptiform abnormality or electrographic seizures during this recording.  Heart rate is 100 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing the patient in a lethargic state due to the presence of: 1. Diffuse slowing of the background.  2. Absence of posterior dominant rhythm. There is no epileptiform activity or electrographic seizures noted.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings could be due to severe metabolic, toxic, anoxic, or infectious encephalopathy or a postictal state.  Alternatively, it could also be due to the effects of sedating medications.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record.  No seizures were captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of intermittent seizures.  If clinically indicated, a bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.  Please note, the patient is tachycardic.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This was an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 7-7.5 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta activity which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm and slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  There is 6-7 Hz diffuse theta activity seen during wakefulness, which is distributed symmetrically.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in no driving response.  Heart rate was 60 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to:
Diffuse slowing of the background with theta activity seen in wakefulness.
Slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
There is no epileptiform activity or electrographic seizures noted during this recording.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above finding could be due to metabolic, toxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of sedating medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record.  No seizures are captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.  If clinically indicated, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or continuous bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Haldol, Cogentin, Claritin and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Impedances were satisfactory, aside from T1, T2. The patient had a previous craniotomy.  This is a routine 26-minute EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is poorly organized.  A posterior dominant rhythm of 10 hertz is noted bilaterally.  It is higher amplitude on the left compared to the right.  A rhythmic delta is noted in either temporal region, right more so than the left.  Despite the breech rhythm, sharp waves were noted in the right central temporal region.  In addition, there are occasional sharp waves noted in pairs on the left.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. At the close of hyperventilation, as the patient becomes drowsy, additional sharp waves are noted, more so in the left temporal region than the right.  In sleep, with an increase in background beta, epileptiform activity is seen from the right anterior temporal region.  Occasional bursts of shifting slowing, including the posterior temporal regions or posterior regions, was also identified.
Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response.  In addition, the patient was starting to transition into stage 2 sleep during photic stimulation.  Right anterior temporal polyspike activity was noted in that transition to stage 2 sleep.
Heart rate:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Independent, right or left temporal sharp waves, some of which are anterior temporal, occasionally with a more posterior temporal region.
Right temporal poly spikes noted in sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The background slowing and disorganization suggest a bihemispheric process.  Right temporal focal slowing is anticipated following a temporal lobectomy.  This patient has persistent epileptiform activity seen from both hemispheres, suggesting more than one localization site for her epilepsy.
This EEG is similar to previous studies. Please call 215 707-4523 if prior studies are needed
