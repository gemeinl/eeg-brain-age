INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm of 50 microvolts with a small amount of l ow voltage frontocentral beta activity. A small amount of background theta Is noted which attenuates when the patient is stimulated. Hyperventilation produces an increase in background theta. Drowsiness follows hyperventilation and is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and, at times, in the transition toward drowsiness, a record that is well-organized without excess theta. Vertex waves are observed In stage I sleep. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. The patient seems to be a bit drowsy and even during photic stimulation transitions Into sleep.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was an awake and a sleep record in very drowsy individual.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm, exceeding 70 mV with posterior slow waves of youth.  In drowsiness there is hypersynchronous rhythmic higher amplitude theta frequency activity ‚Äúhypnogogic‚Äù, ‚Äúhypersynchrony‚Äù.  There were 1 or 2 points of head rocking artifact and there were 1-2 bursts which are slightly asynchronous. Hyperventilation produces hypersynchronous rhythmic high amplitude, somewhat sharply contoured theta frequency activity, but no definitive spike and wave activity. The patient transitions in and out of stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles.  Other features of drowsiness include the hypersynchronous rhythmic theta.
Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG demonstrates multiple normal variants for a young adult.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There was no definitive spike and wave activity, although hyperventilation did produce some rhythmic high amplitude theta.  There were a handful of slightly asynchronous bursts as the patient transitions to drowsiness.  If absence seizures are an important consideration, a repeat fasting EEG, perhaps with a second hyperventilation session maybe helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 12 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  The patient transitions in and out wakefulness to stage 2 sleep.  There is an increase in beta following by vertex waves, POSTS and spindles.  This seems to be a very sleepy patient with the appearance of stage 2 sleep and then eye movement as if he is either very sleepy or having difficulty sustaining sleep.  Photic stimulation elicited a driving response, although the patient was transitioning in and out of stage 2 sleep with a suggestion of even early slow wave sleep.
Heart rate 54 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This individual appears to be quite sleepy which would be the case if this was a sleep-deprived EEG or this was a difficult area for the patient to really get comfortable and stay asleep with.  The bradycardia may be evaluated as indicated.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the lab using the standard international 10/20 system of electrode placement in addition to T1 and T2 electrodes and 1-channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness only.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 9-10 Hz in frequency, 20-40 microvolts in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude, frontal central beta activity which is distributed symmetrically.  Hyperventilation results in symmetric slowing of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate is 70-80 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness only.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy/  if seizures are clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.

HISTORY:  A 62-year-old woman with past medical history of anxiety that has been having constant jerking episodes when falling asleep of her extremities, abdomen and face that lately have worsened in frequency and have become intolerable and do not permit her to go to sleep.  She is here for classification of these episodes, rule out seizures/myoclonus versus nonepileptic spells.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Overall, the background appears to be normal.  However, as the patient becomes drowsy, intermittent muscle artifact jerks can be seen throughout the recording, at times the EMG artifact could be noted more over the left temporalis muscle than the right.  There appears to be no preceding cortical discharge prior to this muscle artifact.  The video does not reveal clear facial jerks although the technician reports that she noticed some facial jerking irregularly. At one point, the patient does have some abdominal flexion which occurs congruously or at the same time as the muscle artifact occurred. Again, none of these artifacts have a preceding cortical discharge that could be clearly seen.
