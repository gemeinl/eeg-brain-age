CLINICAL HISTORY: 71 year old woman with epilepsy, admitting with recurrent seizures and sedation.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Keppra, Lamictal

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is relatively somnolent. Photic simulation is performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a somewhat disorganized pattern. The patient is actually drowsy for much of the record and drifts in and out of stage II sleep. There is a bit of irregular slowing, asymmetric spindles in stage II sleep, more prominent on the left, and occasional right temporal sharp waves. Brief arousals are noted. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is still somewhat sleepy, and there is primarily muscle artifact rather than driving.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background disorganization.
2. Right temporal sharp wave.
3. Beta asymmetry and occasional focal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings have been previously described. No seizures were recorded. The background slowing may represent a postictal state.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient has a trach and is poorly responsive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG initially demonstrates a very low voltage suppressed pattern. Superimposed upon this, are-sharp waves in the right hemisphere which typically start in the right posterior quadrant and end in the right anterior region. They seem to occur as a couplet and with posterior sharp waves first and then an anterior sharp wave which follows and can occur up to a second later. In some cases, this seems to occur a second and a half later, but the epileptiform activity typically seems to occur with 2-3 discharges at a time. Over the course of the record, there is an improvement in the background with an increase in beta and alpha frequency activity. The epileptiform activity remains relatively in variant.

IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Periodic complexes in the right hemisphere with complex epileptiform activity with unusual localization starting in the posterior region and then ending over a long duration of time to the anterior region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as well as an epileptogenic process on the right.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using a standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient reports he has not had a seizure since March.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and produces sustained, rhythmic right frontotemporal 2-3 Hertz activity. Following this, as the patient drifts into sleep there are rare right anterior temporal sharp waves noted. The patient is awakened from sleep for photic stimulation which elicits a generally bilateral driving response which is relatively subtle but there is also rhythmic slowing and a handful of sharp waves noted during photic stimulation.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic slowing in the right temporal region.
2. Rare right anterior temporal sharp waves.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are
performed. The patient has a tracheostomy and is on supplemental oxygen and is poorly
responsive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a medium to low
voltage pattern. The right hemisphere includes primarily a 6 Hz rhythmic background with a
smaller amount of alpha frequency activity and a suggestion of a theta frequency, posterior dominant rhythm. The activity from the left hemisphere is lower voltage, slower, although the posterior dominant rhythm is, on occasion, identified. Brief arousals in the record are associated with an increase in alpha frequency activity, right greater than left. There is occasional frontal delta left greater than right. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving, right greater than left. Heart rate 84 BPM. At the close of the record, asymmetric eye movement artifact is identified, again primarily in the left frontal region. There is a combination of eye artifact higher amplitude on the
left than the right and some left frontocentral slowing with occasional C3 sharp waves.

HR: 84 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Interhemispheric asymmetry with lower voltage, slower activity on the left.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a significantly slow pattern on the right with lower voltage, mixed theta delta pattern. The left hemisphere demonstrates arrhythmic delta activity with high amplitude epileptiform activity with complex field of spread including posterior temporal. Some of the epileptiform activity is at the vertex. Much of it appears at PZ or T5. There is an electropositivity at CZ that marches through in the averaged reference with an electronegativity P3T5. In addition, there are other wave forms that are actually electronegative and maximum at PZCA compatible with very complex epileptiform activity. The highest amplitude activity is a left posterior temporal spike focus. The epileptiform activity occurs. as frequent but relatively isolated discharges which do not evolve, although the activity at CZPZ does seem to have more of a rhythmic pattern. Photic stimulation does not appreciably change the EEG.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Complex epileptiform activity in the left hemisphere with an unusual field of spread.
2. Epileptiform activity at CZPZ.
3. Arrhythmic delta on the left.
4. More rhythmic lower voltage slowing on the right.

The activity in both hemispheres is sharply contoured and although there is some artifact, there is also suggestion of a T4 sharp wave not well evaluated by this study nor well defined sharply contoured delta at T3. Using alternative montages, the sharp activity does seem to be a bit more 01 than T3 or T5.
HR: 160 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. In the sharply contoured record, primarily a left posterior sharp.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is most supportive of a focal mechanism for epileptic procedures. If additional information is needed, a follow up study as this patient improves may be of value.

MEDICATIONS: Percocet, Valium.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a well-defined 9 Hz alpha rhythm which is slightly higher in amplitude on the left than the right. There is occasional, slightly irregular slowing in the temporal regions, notched, 5 Hz activity is noted in the frontal region which is typically symmetric and bilateral. Features of drowsiness could an increase in background stowing. Vertex waves are identified in stage I sleep. Hyperventilation is performed with good effort producing bursts of rhythmic frontal activity which is somewhat sharply contoured. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. The primary abnormalities in this record are frontal or frontocentral sharp and slow waves. This occurs on rare occasions. It can be differentiated from the rhythmic flat top shaped 5 Hz activity in the background. It is associated with well-defined higher amplitude sharp wave. During photic stimulation, there is also a burst of notched rhythmic theta frequency activity but not a definitive generalized spike and wave complex.
HR: N/A
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rare, right frontal sharp waves.
2. Shifting slowing.
3. Small degree of background disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This individual does demonstrate some normal variants but there is a definitive sharp wave observed in the right frontal region. A potentially generalized mechanism for seizures may have been overlooked given the findings described on one occasion during hyperventilation. In this individual who is currently postictal, a follow-up study may be helpful to more clearly define all potential underlying epileptiform pathology for this individual.

Photic stimulation elicits little in the way of a driving response. Drowsiness is
characterized by an accentuation of the focal slowing, as well as more of a distribution
of the focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant. Hyperventilation seems to
accentuate the focal slowing more in a central temporal or central parietal distribution.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake, staring. There is no mention as to the exact location of his craniotomy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The normal morphology of an awake adult are absent in this record, which is primarily low voltage beta. There is some rhythmic artifacts. Eye movement artifacts are out of phase, raising the possibility of disconjugate eye movements. There is some rhythmic delta in the right posterior quadrant. Stimulation of the patient produces muscle artifact. As the recording continues, the eye movements are more symmetric. When the patient is unstimulated as the recording continues, the overall pattern is one of delta and theta with a featureless pattern, particularly missing faster frequency activity with slower, more rhythmic delta activity in the right occipital region and then less rhythmic delta in the left occipital region. Stimulation of the patient increases eye movement artifact.
HR: 130 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Very slow, featureless, background.
2. An asymmetry in the occipital regions with more rhythmic slowing on the right and more arrhythmic slowing on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. This EEG supports a significant disturbance of cerebral function, which may be chronic particularly in that the patient at least has eye opening and eye movement with some degree of interactivity.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. This is a
postictal recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. The patient is drowsy with an increase in theta noted.
The background EEG demonstrates frequent bursts of frontally predominantly 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity. There is some head rocking artifact, but the spike and wave activity is typically high amplitude, frontally predominantly with bursts lasting less than 2 seconds, and ranges from 3 to 3.5 Hz.
The patient is falling asleep with photic stimulation. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response at faster flash frequencies. There is also some spike and wave activity noted In photic, which is somewhat slower, more compatible with a drowsy pattern than a photic paroxysmal response. Other features to suggest that the patient is falling asleep In photic stimulation include vertex waves and spindles.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Frontally predominant 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity.
2. Some polyspike and wave activity.
3. Mild background slowing compatible with postictal state.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is most consistent with an inheritance mechanism for seizures. Because there is a small degree of background slowing in this still postictal adult, a follow up study In the lab may be of value.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are
performed. The family reports that the patient had a seizure earlier this morning.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is awake and cooperative. The overall
background is slow, disorganized with primarily a theta frequency background. Lambda is noted
in the background. Independent bursts of high amplitude, sharp waves of approximately 160
microseconds and greater than 100 millivolts are identified in brief bursts typically lasting less
than 10 seconds from the right or left temporal region. The sharp waves also occur individually
and there are some sharply contoured slowing. Features of drowsiness include an increase in
beta activity. The epileptiform activity has a more extensive field of spread into the anterior
temporal regions in drowsiness and even into T6/02 as the patient becomes sleepy. This
phenomenon is also seen on the left with more and more of a mid to posterior temporal
localization as the patient drifts off to sleep. Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response. It
increases the epileptiform activity which is, however, quite prominent during photic stimulation.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is confused.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an interhemispheric asymmetry. There is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm on the right. The right hemisphere demonstrates generous beta, a small amount of disorganization, and excess theta. The left hemisphere includes a great deal of muscle and motion artifact, but includes nearly continuous arrhythmic delta activity with sharp waves mixed in. In addition to the sharp waves, there are features that suggest that this is an ongoing, ictal pattern, and that the activity in the left mid temporal region waxes and wanes. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta frequency activity. The record has ongoing sharp waves and rhythmic mixed theta delta, but not the same frequency evolution as when the patient started to become sleepy. He is awakened for photic stimulation. Again, there is a bit more rhythmic theta and the sharp waves. No definitive photic driving is noted.

INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient keeps a log. He is able to push the button for all of the events that he experiences. He has multiple episodes of dizziness or disorienting feeling.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 hertz posterior dominant rhythm which is symmetrically reactive. Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background theta with vertex waves, spindles and stage II sleep. There is an epoch in which REM sleep is seen.
In the interictal EEG, there is a single left temporal sharp wave.
Events: The patient has multiple dizzy spells including 1:29, 1:25, 3:12, 3:36, 5:36, 5:46 and then there are no additional push buttons noted.
Although not all of the seizures have a clear clinical correlate and some have only either subtle theta or subtle disruption of faster frequency activity in the left temporal region, some have clear, rhythmic 4 hertz theta from the left temporal region with some spread to the frontocentral region bilaterally, typically lasting 20-40 seconds. The patient receives Depakote at 2:20 p.m., the discharges are briefer, more evanescent more allusive.
Event time 12930: the patient has a dizzy spell characterized by decreased alpha frequency activity from the left temporal region and a brief burst of left temporal theta.
Event time: 2:32 p.m.: There is a brief burst of left temporal theta which differs from the background.
Event time: 3:12p.m.: Aura of dizziness, left temporal theta.
Event #3: Aura characterized by dizziness time 335 to 33729, rhythmic temporal theta as described above.
Event #4: Subtle left temporal theta at 3:53:52.
Event #5: 536, very subtle left temporal theta.
Event #6: Aura 5:46:13, brief burst of left temporal theta.
HR: 100 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG monitoring due to:
1. Subtle, intermittent attenuation of alpha frequency activity in the left temporal region.
2. A handful of well defined auras characterized by rhythmic 4 hertz theta with clear frequency evolution. The characteristic seizure pattern for this patient includes attenuation of alpha in the region, then the theta and then some bilateral frontocentral spread.
3. Rare interictal findings including sharp waves in the left temporal region and sharply contoured theta. An example of this is at 4:35:37 a.m. on the morning of the second.

He has multiple clinical seizures characterized by twitching on the right. In addition, he has a vagal nerve stimulator. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG even before the patient begins to have seizures is markedly abnormal. The right hemisphere is slow with a theta frequency pattern and the left hemisphere has a higher amplitude sharply contoured delta in the context of a breach rhythm. The left TS sharp waves are noted. The TS sharp waves start to build up into a train and as they do, fast activity is noted particularly in the central regions Cz/C3 and then with some transmission to the contralateral side. Using alternative montages, the activity seems to generate from TS to a Cv/C3 focus. The activity can also be reviewed with average reference and seems to emanate from TS to a CZ more than C3 focus, building up along the midline with 13 Hz activity which gradually slows and the seizure seems to end in the left central parietal region with a spiking at CZ rather than P3 or TS. In the postictal section, the background is slow and then additional seizures build up again with this bursts of 13 Hz activity in the left central and midline region. The patient is uncomfortable during the seizures. In addition, he is drowsy but is somewhat responsive. He experiences uncomfortable focal motor activity and confusion and staring. Multiple brief seizures occur during the EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well
organized. There is a 9 Hz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm identified. It is

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The left hemisphere includes a mixture of theta frequency activity with some arrhythmic delta activity and some beta. The right hemisphere demonstrates a relatively suppressed background particularly in the posterior temporal region. The frontocentral regions demonstrate some mixed frequency activity. The major abnormality in this record is a high amplitude left occipital spike and slow wave complex which is seen as frequently as 5 discharges in 20 seconds but sometimes is infrequently as only 2. This is a very high amplitude irritative focus but it no longer evolves.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Prominent high amplitude right occipital spike and slow wave complex.
2. Right occipital temporal suppression of cerebral activity.
3. Moderate background slowing from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is markedly improved and the patient is no longer having seizures and the epileptiform activity is isolated and it no longer revolves. These findings are congruent with the MRI which demonstrates a significant right TCA stroke.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10╖20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has been somewhat sedated and is
relatively motionless throughout the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes an abnormal pattern. There
is generous beta In the frontocentral regions and a suggestion of a breech rhythm in the central
regions. Prominent arrhythmic delta activity and disruption of faster frequency activity is noted in
the frontotemporal regions bilaterally, more so on the right than on the left, and the activity from
the right frontal region is a bit more featureless when compared to the left. Vertex waves are
noted as the patient transitions into sleep. There is significant variability in the record in terms of
the amount of beta frequency activity. As the patient becomes drowsy, the EEG becomes lower
voltage, slower and intermittently attenuates although it is not frankly discontinuous. Sharply
contoured slowing is noted Intermittently in the frontocentral reg ions.
HR: 120bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Prominent arrhythmic delta activity and disruption of faster frequency activity in the
frontotemporal regions, right more so than the left.
3. Occasional sharp waves in the right frontocentral region.
4. Intermittent attenuation of the background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a significant bihemispheric disturbance, in
particular, one that involves the frontotemporal regions. Although there are a handful of sharp
waves, there are no prominent epileptiform features. Overall this EEG supports a bilateral,
significant disturbance of cerebral function.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat
disorganized and slow with an alpha rhythm of 7.5 Hz. Hyperventilation is performed early on in
the record, producing an increase in slowing with rhythmic frontal theta and delta and some
shifting slowing. Paroxysmal rhythmic slowing is noted, which is a bit more prominent on the

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is extremely restless during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Despite the muscle and movement artifact, there is primarily a theta frequency background. In the posterior regions, there is a bit more slower theta. There is a suggestion of greater arrhythmic delta activity in the right frontal central region. As the recording continues, the patient permits a cloth over his eyes and gradually relaxes. Again, primarily a theta frequency pattern is noted, but the activity is slower with a bit more arrhythmic delta activity in the right hemisphere. A breach rhythm is noted in the frontocentral regions.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Superimposed focal slowing with slowing of the theta frequency on the right and a bit more frontocentral delta.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive and a small amount of 11 Hz activity noted in the background bilaterally. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of alpha rhythm and disruption of the alpha rhythm. Notable findings in this record include sharply contoured delta or bursts of rhythmic frontal sharply contoured theta in the right frontal region typically at F8 or T2, reaching amplitudes up to 80 microvolts. While there are no definitive sharp and slow wave complexes, in some cases this is simply because of the duration of the discharge, not the actual morphology. Hyperventilation and drowsiness seem to accentuate this finding. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving at faster flash frequencies.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Sharply contoured rhythmic, delta in the right frontal temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Although there was some eye artifact noted in the record, the eye artifact can be excluded with the use of an average reference and there is clearly a focus in the right frontal temporal region which can be differentiated from the eye movement.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a prominent interhemispheric asymmetry. There are sections of the record with a posterior dominant rhythm observed of 10 Hz. This is more easily identified from the left than the right. Prominent features in this EEG include a breech rhythm, high amplitude sharp waves from the left frontal and frontotemporal region with rhythmic frontal or frontal temporal mixed theta delta. There are some sections in the record where the sharp waves abate briefly. Features of stage 2 sleep include well defined 13 Hz spindles present bilaterally. The focal slowing is seen in stage 2 sleep. On one occasion stimulation of the patient produces a burst of left frontal temporal sharp waves. The patient does alert, but the stimulation seems to have augmented the epileptiform activity. In sleep there is a significant decrease in epileptiform activity.

Focal delta is noted in the right temporal region as well as a prominent craniotomy defect with double phase reversing artifact. There is some sharply contoured slowing with a phase reversal at T6. Posts are noted in stage I sleep. Vertex waves, K complexes and spindles are noted in sleep, and in fact the focal slowing and the sharply contoured slowing is much less prominent in sleep. Photic stimulation is performed in individuals in stage II sleep and does not clearly activate the record. Hyperventilation seems
to accentuate the focal features.
HR: 78bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Continuous focal slowing from the right temporal region with disruption of faster frequency activity.
2. Disruption of both alpha and MU rhythms on the right.
3. Sharply contoured slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In the context of breach rhythm, epileptiform activity may be difficult to characterize. If there are any additional questions, a follow up study should be considered.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system in addition to anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  Wakefulness and sleep were recorded.  Photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow EEG which is mainly in sleep, stage I and stage II.  There is a brief amount of wakefulness which is elicited after the technician stimulates the patient with sternal rub and noxious stimulation to the nose.  During that time, the patient actually responds and opens his eyes.  Upon eyes closing the best posterior dominant rhythm achieved is 7 Hz with a 20 to 60 microvolt amplitude.  There is some frontal central beta seen.  Activating procedures with photic stimulation reveal no abnormal discharges; however, stimulation does improve the frequency of the EEG but it never reaches normal background.

1. There is generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 mV and an asymmetry between the right and left hemisphere. There are faster frequencies noted over the left hemisphere, at best 5-7 Hz, however, this is not seen over the right hemisphere.
2. There are focal sharp waves at F3 / C3. During the recording they appear more prominent in wakefulness. After the first 2 hours they become more blunted and less sharp, later they almost disappear leaving focal slow waves.

SEIZURES: None.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized slow waves.
2. Focal sharp waves in the left frontal region, later becoming blunted; but continues to become prominent during wakefulness.
3. Focal slower waves in the left centro-frontal region.
4. Lack of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The patient has a prominent craniotomy deformity with a breach rhythm in the right temporal region.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9-Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Hyperventilation is performed early in the record, clearly accentuating focal slowing in the right temporal region.  After this, as the patient becomes drowsy there are occasional right anterior temporal spike or sharp waves observed.  These can be differentiated from the EKG artifact.  There is also some double-phase reversing artifact noted in the same region.  Features of sleep include vertex waves.  K-complexes are also noted.  The epileptiform activity is noted following hyperventilation and early drowsiness primarily and not so much in sleep.   Photic stimulation elicits scant driving, more so on the left.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right temporal focal slowing.
In this sharply contoured record, right temporal sharp waves.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, this patient is in stage 1 sleep with vertex waves.  She transitions in and out of stage 1 sleep to wakefulness.  The patient rapidly transitions in and out of stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.  She is falling asleep during photic stimulation.
There is a single paroxysmal burst noted in that transition which is generalized, but is suspicious for a discharge on the left.  As she is falling asleep during photic stimulation, there are a handful of bursts with isolated paroxysmal 5 Hz activity, but not definitive spike and wave activity.  The individual appears to be excessively sleepy.  Limited wakefulness is achieved.

2 subtle bursts of 5 Hz activity not exactly during photic stimulation, but around the time of photic stimulation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG did not adequately identify epileptiform activity.  There are, of course, constraints in the evaluation of a pregnant patient.  The features
described above are suspicious for a inherited mechanism for epilepsy, but are not definitive.  A follow-up study may be helpful to search for epileptiform activity.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  As the record begins, the activity includes a prominent interhemispheric asymmetry.  It is medium amplitude, but slow, primarily theta on the right with some occasional posterior delta.  From there left there is clearly a breach with a high amplitude spike and slow-wave complex at T3 and T5.  It is also picked up at C3/P3.
The first seizure occurs within 1 minute with a burst of 14 Hz activity emanating from the left frontal region with frequency evolution.  This is over 4 minutes and 35 seconds into the EEG.  Additional seizure occurs at 4 minutes and 40 seconds, and another similar seizure with the fast activity from the left frontal region at 3 Hz photic stimulation.  In that seizure, focal spiking is noted at T5.  Photic stimulation does not otherwise activate the record.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing to the left hemisphere with disruption of faster frequency activity.
Modest slowing from the right.
Epileptiform activity in the left hemisphere which may be centrotemporal, left hemispheric, or left posterior temple.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow, low amplitude background with an asymmetric hemisphere amplitude and frequency.  Over the right hemisphere, there appears to be marked attenuation and lack of faster frequencies with some focal F8/T4 slowing.  Over the left hemisphere, there appears to be diffuse slowing, however, while the patient is stimulated, there appeared to be an increase of the faster frequencies and some reactivity.  No normal frontocentral beta is seen.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No photic stimulation or hyperventilation was performed.

MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In relaxed wakefulness, there are brief bursts of 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity.  Hyperventilation is performed early in the record producing bursts of frontally predominant spike and slow wave activity, some of which are isolated, some of which are associated with frontal delta.  These are present bilaterally, but with a somewhat more generous field of spread posteriorly on the left.  Hyperventilation produces the bursts of spike and wave activity, but which seemed to be associated with a little jerking of the leg, but which were all less than 1 second in duration and were not associated with impairment of awareness.  As he drifts off to sleep, there is an increase in beta and some faster spike and wave complexes occurring as couplets.  Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.  Photic driving is noted at low frequency stimuli and immediately after photic is completed, spike and wave activity is observed.  There is some head rocking or single-channel electrode at P3 at the end of the EEG.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Frontally predominant 3-5.5 Hz spike and wave activity noted in relaxed wakefulness and accentuated by hyperventilation, but no photic stimulation.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with an additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz only seen over the left hemisphere.  Over the right hemisphere there is attenuation of all frequencies, including beta frequency, which can only be seen over the left hemisphere.  The patient is only recorded during wakefulness.
Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.  However, during hyperventilation the patient does start complaining of left arm numbness and pain.  During this time and intermittently there appears to be a change in the EKG lead to what appears to be bigeminy for seconds intermittently.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal attenuation of the entire right hemisphere and disruption of the posterior dominant rhythm seen throughout the recording.
Mild excessive theta in wakefulness, along with bursts of FIRDA in wakefulness.
SEIZURES:  During the recording the patient complained of her left arm hurting, which is consistent with her typical events, but there is no EEG correlate during this event.  The patient did not loose consciousness.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right hemisphere attenuation and disruption of the posterior dominant rhythm in that hemisphere.
Mild generalized slowing.
FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cortical dysfunction in the right hemisphere, which is consistent with a known hemiatrophy seen on the right hemisphere for this patient.  In addition, there is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  The episodes of left arm burning did not have any EEG correlate.  However, please note that up to 75% of simple partial seizures may not be captured during scalp EEG.  Lastly, the patient did have some EKG abnormalities seen throughout the recording.  Due to this the patient was recommended to be seen in the emergency room right after the EEG.  She was taken there for this.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the awake EEG demonstrates asymmetry.  There is a glimpse of an 8 Hz alpha rhythm on the right which is disrupted on the left.  The faster frequency activity is disrupted on the left in the left temporal region relative to the right.  In addition, there is somewhat periodic arrhythmic delta activity with a complex field of spread in the left temporal region.  It may start left mid temporal or posterior temporal and then spread to the left hemisphere, particularly centrotemporal regions or the left posterior temporal area.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there are some bursts of frontal delta bilaterally.  Other features of drowsiness include an accentuation of the left temporal focal slowing. Rare left temporal sharp waves maximum at T1-T3 are observed.  Photic stimulation elicits driving.  Heart rate 104 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
A slightly slow and disorganized record on the right.
Arrhythmic delta in the left hemisphere with some poorly formed periodic complexes in the left.
Rare left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural or functional process on the left, involving gray and white matter.  These sharp waves are congruent with the prior left MCA infarct.  This EEG is similar to 2 prior EEGs for this patient.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz microvolt posterior dominant rhythm.  In relaxed wakefulness and in hyperventilation, there is rhythmic 3-5 Hz activity in the right temporal region.  Some of this occurs in bursts, but without definitive frequency evolution.  The bursts of rhythmic temporal theta delta may be associated with right temporal sharp waves.  In hyperventilation, the alpha rhythm is also disrupted relative to the alpha on the contralateral side.  Features of drowsiness include accentuation of the right temporal slowing and sharp waves.  Photic stimulation elicits a driving response a little bit more vigorous on the left than the right.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Prominent rhythmic right temporal focal slowing.
Right anterior temporal sharp waves.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel  EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG includes a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The patient transitions in and out of sleep with prominent, hypnagogic hypersynchrony.  During photic stimulation, however, 6 Hz spike and wave activity is noted.  This is noted again during photic stimulation with a 5.5 Hz very brief spike and wave complex during various different photic stimulation parameters. Hyperventilation seems to accentuate the frontally predominant relatively symmetric spike and wave activity. On at least 1 occasion during the EEG, neuro artifact is noted, but no definitive vagal nerve stimulator artifact was observed.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Frontally predominant 5.5 Hz spike and wave activity accentuated by hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Hypnagogic hypersynchrony is a normal phenomenon, but may resemble a forme-fruste of the generalized spike and wave activity.  This patient clearly had generalized spike and wave activity.  This is more supportive of a generalized mechanism for epilepsy.  In this particular EEG, there were no asymmetries and there is otherwise a normal background.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with  channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In apparent wakefulness, there is a glimpse of 9 Hz alpha rhythm, but there is excess theta.  Higher amplitude, triangular shaped, frontal delta was noted even prior to hyperventilation.
Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the high amplitude theta, as well as the bursts of FIRDA.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to recurring electrographic left posterior temporal seizures, in addition to left posterior temporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is consistent with the known AVM.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to activity and may be due at least in part due to medication affect.  These findings were reported to the primary team as soon as the EEG was read at 7:00 p.m. on 10/22/2012.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was awake and conversant throughout.  He has a prominent, frontal craniotomy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This is an unusual and dynamic EEG.  Some sections of the record demonstrate a pretty well organized background with a lower voltage alpha rhythm of 11 Hz and some lower voltage frontocentral theta.  Other sections of the record demonstrated bursts of high amplitude, bifrontal sharp waves or spikes.  These occur with the patient relaxing comfortably but were accentuated by hyperventilation.  The epileptiform activity is usually bilateral but can be maximum in the right or left frontal region.  There can be a polyspike component at FP1, F3 or FP2.  The bursts of slow spike-and-wave activity are associated with background slowing, and bursts of epileptiform activity or bursts of slowing with epileptiform may be on the order of two seconds or longer.  Aside from these bursts, the patient is awake, alert, and conversant.  The bursts are brief enough that it is difficult to determine if they are clinically significant.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using the standard international 10/20 system of electrode placement in addition to 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through stage II sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  in the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 11-12 Hz in frequency, 40-50 microvolts in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically, stage I sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifacts as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and posts.  Stage II sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes, sleep spindles, and posts.  There are occasional bursts of left anterior and mid temporal slowing at 67/T3 in wakefulness and sleep consisting of 3-3.5 Hz delta frequency, mixed with 4-5 Hz theta activity lasting for 1-2 seconds.  There were no epileptiform discharges or seizures noted during this recording.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate was 60 beats per minutes and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to the left temporal slowing seen during wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings are suggestive of a structural abnormality in the left hemisphere or left temporal dysfunction in this case secondary to history of left MCA stroke.  There were no epileptiform activities or seizures noted during this recording.  If seizure activity is a clinical concern, a bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake and drowsy.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is a lack of normal frontal central beta.  Overall, the background has intermittent generalized slowing, even during wakefulness in the theta range, which is intermixed with a frontal predominant delta slowing seen in the bilateral frontal regions.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient is a 61-year-old man with right basal ganglia hemorrhage.  He now has a change in mental status.  EEG is being performed to rule out subclinical seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  During wakefulness, the background consists of a mixture of low to moderate amplitude, at times sharply contoured theta and delta activity with under-riding faster frequencies, as well as some occasional waveforms of triphasic morphology.  During sleep, background voltage decreases and the background consists of a mixture of theta and delta activity that is better organized.  Additional nearly continuous polymorphic delta activity is observed over the right hemisphere and is mostly pronounced over the frontotemporal regions.  There are occasional variable amplitude sharp waves with  aftergoing slow waves observed over the right occipital region, right midtemporal region, and right centroparietal region.  Occasionally, the discharges over the right central temporoparietal region are synchronized.  Once asleep, frequency of the discharges improves and they are only rarely observed over the right midtemporal region.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not observed.  There were no clear electrographic seizures.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing and disorganization.
Multifocal sharp waves over the right hemisphere, observed over the occipital region, midtemporal region, and centroparietal region.
EEG shows normalization during sleep.
No electrographic seizures.S
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal awake and asleep 22-minute electroencephalogram due to moderate diffuse slowing, disorganization, and the multifocal sharp waves observed over the right hemisphere, and focal right hemispheric slowing most pronounced over the right frontotemporal region.  Diffuse slowing and disorganization indicate moderate degree of cerebral dysfunction that is etiologically nonspecific.  Focal right hemispheric slowing indicates underlying focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology and is consistent with patient's history of right basal ganglia hemorrhage.  Multifocal sharp waves over the right hemisphere indicate increased epileptogenic potential, however, since they improve during sleep they are more likely to be related to toxic metabolic disturbance.  There are no clear electrographic seizures.

The patient appears to be quite sleepy and drifting off.  Stage I sleep is characterized by disappearance of eye blink artifact and muscle artifact and appearance of posts and vertex sharp transients.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm and excess theta activity during wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The findings are consistent with mild encephalopathy that can be caused by toxic metabolic degenerative infectious etiologies.  This pattern was seen in his previous EEGs.  There were no epileptiform activities or seizures were identified during this recording.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  The absence of epileptiform discharges does not exclude epilepsy or intermittent seizures.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 73-year-old man who presents with new onset of loss of consciousness on 12/27/2012 that lasted less than 15 seconds with return to baseline.  Prior to the event the patient felt a warm sensation rising to his head.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  During very brief arousal there is no clear posterior dominant rhythm and no clear anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background during very brief arousal consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta activity mixed with under-riding faster frequencies.  There is excess beta seen diffusely.  During sleep, symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, and K complexes are captured.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in no additional abnormalities.
FINDINGS:
Mild diffuse slowing.
No clear epileptiform discharges.
Primarily asleep study
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal minimally awake, mostly asleep, 22-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing.  This finding indicates etiologically nonspecific mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, however, it could also represent excessively drowsy patient.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of aneurysmal surgery, left frontal stroke, hemiparesis, and seizures.  EEG is being performed to assess the patient's baseline.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include phenobarbital, Dilantin, Prozac, and others.
CONDITION OF RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10/20 system, with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is continuous right to left interhemispheric asymmetry with faster waveforms over the left hemisphere.  Of note, the patient is asleep throughout most of the recording.  During brief wakefulness, the posterior dominant rhythm over the left consists of moderate amplitude 9-10 Hz alpha activity. PGR No comment can be made about reactivity.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient over the left hemisphere.  Additionally, continuous excess beta activity is captured over the left hemisphere.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the right hemisphere is not clearly visualized.  The background during maximal wakefulness over the right consists of a mixture of polymorphic alpha and theta activity.  Additional polymorphic delta activity with paucity of faster frequencies is observed during drowsiness and sleep over the right hemisphere, primarily over the right frontotemporal region.  Intermittent moderate to high amplitude sharp waves with aftergoing slow waves are captured over the right anterior temporal region.  Phase reversal occurs over F8/T4 electrodes.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in no additional abnormalities.
FINDINGS:
Continuous moderate right hemispheric slowing, most pronounced over the right frontotemporal region.
Excess beta activity observed over the left hemisphere.
Suspected breach artifact over the left hemisphere.
Intermittent sharp waves with aftergoing slow waves over the right anterior temporal region, with phase reversal over F8/T4 electrodes.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal, mostly asleep, very briefly awake EEG due to continuous focal right hemispheric slowing, that is most pronounced over the right frontotemporal region, and intermittent epileptiform discharges over the right anterior temporal region.  These findings indicate likely underlying focal cerebral dysfunction that carries increased epileptogenic potential.  Excess beta observed over the left hemisphere could be secondary to the medication effect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates. Breach effect could be secondary to a skull defect. Breach effect over that region.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital EEG was performed in lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is slow with the posterior dominant rhythm of 7-8 Hz through a excess theta activity during wakefulness.  Drowsiness was characterized by more slowing of the background activity and loss of absence of eye blink artifact and muscle artifact.  There is right breach rhythm.  There is also almost continuous right temporal slowing with a frequency of 4.5-5 Hz.  There are occasional bursts of left temporal slowing.  There are intermittent spikes noted with maximum voltage at T4 with no evolutions.  Heart rate was 80 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing. Diffuse background slowing
Right breach rhythm.
Continuous right temporal slowing.
Occasional left temporal slowing.
Spikes T4(Right Temporal) occasionally with no evolution, or seizures.
CLINICAL CORRELATIONS:  Diffuse slowing is indicative of bihemispheric dysfunctions that could be due to infectious, degenerative, hypoxic ischemic, postictal, and toxic metabolic etiologies. Clinical correlation is recommended.  Right breach rhythm could be due to the history of craniotomy in the past. Continuous right temporal slowing could be due to structural lesions in the right temporal region.  The presence of spike in right temporal region is indicative of hyperexcitability of cortex in this area that places this patient at higher risk for partial seizures.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible for this very confused and agitated individual.  The patient had multiple episodes of left hemibody shaking.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In apparent wakefulness, the background EEG is disorganized. There is some seconds in the awake record where there is a 9 hertz alpha rhythm seen on the right.  The left hemisphere demonstrates more beta as well as a breech rhythm and a phase reversal at T5.  The patient's episodes of tremulousness on the left seem to be associated  with physical discomfort or pain.  He is responsive during the events, but does not seem to recall them afterwards.
In addition, he has intermittent restlessness of the right leg which is not stereotypic in nature.
The behavioral episodes of shaking on the left are associated with muscle artifact but without a definitive EEG pattern.
Heart rate 108.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
A superimposed area of focal slowing most prominent in the left posterior temporal region.
In the sharply contoured background with a breech rhythm is suggestion of a T5 sharp wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's motor behaviors were not associated with a well defined EEG change aside from the muscle artifact.  There is perhaps an area noted with one of the behavioral spells with perhaps a CZC4 spike but the vast majority of the patient's clinical seizures were not associated with a distinct EEG signature.
This EEG is most supportive of an epilepsia partialis continua phenomenon.  This is a technically challenging EEG due to the patient's physical discomfort and agitation, but consideration for a CZC4 epileptiform focus is appropriate. Compared to previous EEGs, the T5 focal slowing has been previously described.  Previous sharp waves have been noted from either hemisphere.  The seizure type described today seems to be a new seizure for this individual.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was a technical difficult bedside record in a critically ill patient who was receiving treatments during the EEG and awaiting dialysis.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly slow but continuous and lacks the typical hallmarks of either an awake or asleep individual in this obtunded patient.  There is primarily rhythmic theta with some arrhythmic delta.  Although this is a technically challenging record with perhaps some attenuation in the electrodes in the right temporal region, there is an occasional right occipital temporal sharp wave noted in the background.  No clinical jerking of the extremities is seen with the jerking.  Finally, predominant triphasic waves were noted as was shifting slowing in this overall slow record.  Intermittent attenuations were noted.
Towards the close of the record, intermittent jerking was noted.  On some occasions this was associated with movement artifact, on other occasions attenuation and on other occasions the jerkiness is associated with an overall attenuation of the background.
Heart rate:  120 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with primarily a theta frequency background.
Shifting slowing.
Triphasic waves.
A right occipital sharp wave.
Intermittent attenuation of the background which was sometimes associated with jerking of the body or limbs.

INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  Patient was recorded while lethargic.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software as well as patient notes and nurse's notes and patient alarms were used to review the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  Overall, the recording appears to be mainly in the delta frequencies with some intermittent faster frequencies showing up periodically.  There are some stage changes noted.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen continuously at T5/P3 with a periodicity that ranges from 0.5 Hz to 2 Hz, at times becoming slightly less organized.  These are consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs).
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-40 mV.
SEIZURES:  Although there were about 2-3 rhythmic runs of the PLEDs, there were 2 electrographic seizures.  One occurred at 4:15 p.m. lasting for a minute and a half.  The 2nd one occurred at 9:43 p.m.  Both of them did not appear to have any clear clinical correlate.  They were comprised of rhythmic P3-4/T5 sharp waves, evolving in frequency and amplitude and then suddenly stopping.
HEART RATE:  84.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left posterior temporal and parietal periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) and electrographic seizures in addition to generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals left posterior temporal and parietal seizures as well as a focus of irritability and cerebral dysfunction in that region.  This is likely related to the known lesion in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral  dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology and may be due at least in part to medication effect.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 58-year-old man with bifrontal burr hole and evacuation of subdural hematoma with change in mental status.  His wife noticed lip smacking and staring but never returned to baseline.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra, and Vimpat.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with 1 anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at times reaches 9 Hz which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontal central beta seen better over the left central region, however, there is attenuation of faster frequencies over the left temporal region.  At times, even during wakefulness, there is excessive theta seen throughout.  The patient is only recorded during wakefulness.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Movement artifact throughout the recording.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen continuously over C3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  At times these are sharply contoured but are seen through a breach.
Focal slow waves at C4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Excessive theta in wakefulness at 5-7 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left central continuous focal slowing which are at times sharply contoured in addition to right central focal slowing and excessive theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction in the left central region in addition to independent focal cerebral dysfunction over the right central region, which is consistent with the patient: with a known history of bilateral subdural hemorrhages.  In addition, the faster frequency over the left temporal region is consistent with a known subdural over that region.  There is also evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or definite epileptiform discharges were seen.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10.20  system with 1-channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was completed.  Photic stimulation was not completed.
DESCRIPTION OF BACKGROUND:  In apparent wakefulness, there is an 8 Hertz alpha rhythm with a background with excess theta.  Testing was performed to assure maximal wakefulness and there is some improvement that the background remains with a small amount of excess theta.  Hyperventilation was performed early on in the record producing an increase in amplitude of the background as well as some slowing and head rocking artifact.  Head rocking artifact is noted in the occipitoparietal region, right more so than the left.
Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.  The technologist did extend the EEG but did not capture sleep, although testing was performed for wakefulness.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Mild slowing of the background alpha rhythm.
Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The pattern described above is a nonspecific pattern which might reflect medication affect.  To more completely evaluate this patient for her epilepsy, a repeat study with deeper stages of sleep and photic stimulation is suggested.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, EEG is appropriately organized for age with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Hyperventilation was performed early in the record and clearly accentuated frontally predominant 3-4 Hz spike and wave activity. In hyperventilation, bursts were approximately 2.5 seconds in duration, frontally predominant and symmetric. Following hyperventilation, bursts were seen typically less in a second in duration. Testing was performed during the bursts and no impairment of awareness could be demonstrated. The spike and wave discharges were seen on occasion as the patient transitioned to a drowsy state with attenuation of the alpha rhythm and an increase in beta. Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response but spike and wave discharges occurred after, not during the photic stimulation period.
Heart rate 54 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to frontally predominant 3-4 Hz spike and wave activity with polyspike and wave activity accentuated by hyperventilation and early drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No clinical seizures could be demonstrated in this EEG. All bursts were brief. These findings are identical to a previous EEG 05/04/2007.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized.  At times, the alpha rhythm reaches 10 Hz but at other times is significantly slower.  There is shifting arrhythmic delta in the temporal regions with somewhat rhythmic TIRDA noted from the left or right temporal region with a bit more arrhythmic slowing noted in the right temporal region.  Hyperventilation accentuates these findings.  The patient transitioned in and out of a drowsy state but sleep is not sustained.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.  Significant electrode artifact was noted in some portions of the record.  Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
A somewhat disorganized pattern.
Shifting slowing.
TIRDA noted independently from the right or the left, but right more so than the left.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not possible.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This was an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern. As the EEG begins, the overall pattern is diffusely slow and poorly organized.  There are bursts of high amplitude, generalized transients followed by brief attenuations. In addition, there is a subtle asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency activity on the left compared to the right.  Stimulation of the patient enhances that asymmetry. An alpha rhythm appears on the right of approximately 8 Hz with slower activity on the left.  When the patient is unstimulated, she drifts back into a drowsy pattern. In later portions of the record, this is a lower voltage more featureless pattern.
Photic stimulation was attempted and was complicated by significant photoelectric artifact.  It serve to alert the patient but there was no definitive driving response.  Heart rate 84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing and disorganization.
Focal slowing on the left with disruption of faster frequency activity as well as more slow theta and delta.
Metabolic features with intermittent higher amplitude paroxysmal  discharges followed by attenuation.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not performed but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  There were some electrode artifacts noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm but there are other sections of the record when the patient is awake when the alpha is a little slower, 8-8.5 Hz.  In wakefulness and a little bit more prominently as the patient becomes drowsy, there was focal slowing noted in the left mid temporal region.  In addition, there are also some eye artifacts which are also asymmetric, a little bit more so on the left.  As the patient drifts in and out of sleep, sharp waves emerge, some of which have an unusual field of spread.  Most seem to be in the left midtemporal or left frontal region but with a field involving the right and then there are a handful of rare right midtemporal sharp waves noted as well.  Overall, the epileptiform activity is quite subtle.  There are a handful of vertex waves noted in sleep which phase reverse to the right of midline or the left.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was transitioning into stage II sleep and did not significantly activate the record.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
Focal slowing emerging as the patient becomes drowsy, despite the artifacts described above.
Sharp waves noted in drowsiness with unusual fields of spread, typically left frontal or right anterior temporal.

MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Dilantin, Keppra, and morphine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient has multiple episodes of tremulousness or jerking, more so on the right hemibody than the left.  These were intermittent, and when they stopped the patient was communicative although confused and quite fragile.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  It is a diffusely slow, poorly organized background with apparent craniotomy on the left and high amplitude sharp waves noted on the left posterior, temporal and parietal regions.
The episodes of tremulousness that the patient experienced, which were more so on the right than the left, but with bilateral feet, and without much impairment of awareness, were associated with muscle or movement artifact.  There did not seem to be a postictal confusion, although the events were quite stereotyped in behavior.
Sharp waves from the left hemisphere and sharp waves were noted at T3, T5, P3 and O1.
When the patient was responsive, eye opening and muscle artifact were noted.
Heart rate 120 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background disorganization.
Focal slowing, with more disruption of faster frequency activity on the left compared to the right today.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The seizures today represent a different seizure pattern in comparison to the seizures noted one month ago which seemed to be a pattern from CZ and C4.
The bihemispheric nature of this patient's problems may account for this phenomenon.  Overall, this is a highly epileptiform appearing EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is 9 Hz, in maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is slightly disorganized from the right.  There is a bilateral alpha rhythm.  Rare lambda was noted in wakefulness.  In wakefulness, there is delta noted primarily in the left hemisphere, including left frontal central but with a smaller amount in the right frontal temporal region as well.  As the patient becomes drowsy, slowing of the alpha rhythm and 15 slowing was noted.  The focal slowing from the left hemisphere is most prominent in the transition in and out of sleep.

Focal slowing from the left hemisphere with disruption of faster frequency activity and preference of somewhat rhythmic delta activity.
Background slowing and disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  For this individual with the history of epilepsy and acute traumatic brain injury, no epileptiform features were identified.  The focal findings may be part of this patient's previous CNS pathology.  The diffuse background slowing may be due to the acute issues or a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm was 9-10 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  A stage 1 sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact, as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves.  Stage II sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  During wakefulness, there were 2 bursts of generalized spike and wave, and polyspike discharges seen occurrent with a frequency of 3.5 Hz, which were frontally predominant.  These occurred in bursts lasting for 1-2 seconds.  There was no clinical seizure correlated during these bursts.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response without any photoparoxysmal response.  Hyperventilation was performed and results in symmetric slowing of the background activity.  Heart rate was 60 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through stage II sleep due to generalized spike and wave and polyspike discharges seen during wakefulness.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing began, the patient is in ICU and is very confused and moving about.  The background EEG is markedly abnormal with primarily a theta pattern, poorly organized with generous background beta.  In addition, there are sharp waves noted in the record with more than one localization including C3 and the right temporal region.  There is prominent theta noted in the background.
A burst of right temporal sharp waves and delta was noted at 2:35 but without a clear clinical correlate.  This burst continues as might be anticipated in an electrographic seizure but looking at the video the patient does not appear to be doing anything other than motion arrest.  There is no significant change in the patient's behavior after this 30-second discharge.  Additional bursts of right temporal sharp waves and spikes maximum in the anterior temporal region were noted at 2:47.  At the close of the EEG, the right temporal sharp waves are building up.  They have not yet evolved into the pattern of a seizure.  Of note, the patient has turned his head to the left but testing is not performed and it is difficult to determine if there is really a change in the patient's mental status.  The patient is confused but interactive throughout the EEG.

IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing and disorganization.
Prominent right anterior temporal sharp waves and spikes.
At least 1 electrographic seizure from the right temporal region.
Sharp waves noted on occasion from the left hemisphere as well.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this individual who has had recent, repetitive seizures, this is an ongoing ictal record although it does not meet the formal criteria for a status epilepticus record and the seizure that was recorded appeared to be with little clinical signs or symptoms and was brief.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG demonstrates a burst suppression pattern with approximately 2 bursts every 20 seconds.  The bursts are 1 to 3 seconds in duration, and are associated with a little bit of jerking and oral facial movements.  In addition, in the period of time when the EEG is suppressed, following the bursts there is a very slow oral movement and then eye flicker, a bit of jerking, and oral bursts, and then the mouth opening and closing one more time while the EEG is suppressed.

Tactile stimulation does not activate the record.
The bursts of activity are high amplitude, almost with a 4Hz spike and wave-like burst and then a suppressed background.
Heart rate difficult to discern at times due to the background artifact, but 96 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a burst suppression pattern.
Postanoxic myoclonus with the bursts with oral facial movements.
Absence of reactivity or significant variability.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These are worrisome findings, more than 6 hours status post anoxic insult.  Due to this patient's cardiac condition, hypothermia protocol was initiated and additional EEG will follow.

MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Tegretol, and phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is slow and disorganized with an alpha rhythm of about 6-7 Hz in a pattern more of diffuse theta.  This background is intermittently disrupted by bursts of higher amplitude slowing, which are bilateral, but are more prominent on the left compared to the right.  In a disorganized pattern there is an underlying sharp wave which may be in the left mid to anterior temporal region.  In addition, as the patient transitions into stage 1 sleep with vertex waves, some of these waves forms are also noted.  In stage 1 sleep there appears to be a left posterior temporal sharp wave noted.
In the transition between wakefulness and sleep, there is intermittent disruption of the alpha rhythm on either side.
Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background with hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing.  In addition, it does seem to elicit some asynchronous slowing and there is a question of a frontal spike and slow wave complex, left greater than right, noted in hyperventilation.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Disorganization.
Bursts of paroxysmal higher amplitude slowing, which seemed to be maximum on the left and appear to have a poorly defined underlying left mid anterior temporal sharp wave.
Rare right posterior temporal sharp waves noted in sleep.
Rare left and frontal spike and slow wave complexes in hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a bihemispheric process, but one which may involve the left hemisphere more significantly than the right.  The epileptiform activity has a preponderance in the left hemisphere.  No seizures were recorded.  If additional information is needed, an inpatient EEG monitoring session may be necessary.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during lethargy and confusion.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no longer posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  The patient appears to be awake and no clear sleep architecture is seen.  There is variability and reactivity to the EEG.  No activating procedures were performed.
Abnormal Discharges:
Focal sharp waves seen over the right hemisphere mainly at T4 and at T6, independently at P4 and O2.
Focal slow waves seen over the right hemisphere, maximal at T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 40-60 microvolts.  This is associated with increased asymmetric amplitude and beta over that region consistent with a breach rhythm.
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz and continuously throughout the recording.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to frequent right posterior quadrant sharp waves and breach as well as focal slowing in that region in the setting of generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the right posterior quadrant region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal structural dysfunction and irritability in that region, which is consistent with the known previous lesion and surgery in that region.  No seizures were clearly seen.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in laboratory using the standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures the patient during wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was about 6-7 Hz in frequency.  There was disorganized and diffuse theta activity seen during wakefulness.  The background activity was intermittently disrupted by burst of higher amplitude bilateral delta activity most pronounced on the left side.  There were also rare left frontotemporal spike and slow wave complexes noted during hyperventilation with no evolution.  A stage 1 sleep was characterized by the presence of transient sharp waves and posts.  Hyperventilation was performed and characterized by high amplitude rhythmic delta activities.  Photic stimulation was performed and results in no driving response.  Heart rate was 60 to 70 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to;
Slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm and generalized background activity.
Burst of paroxysmal high amplitude and at times sharply contoured delta waves, most pronounced on the left side.
Rare left frontotemporal spike and slow wave complexes during hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Diffuse slowing of the background is suggestive of toxic, metabolic, infectious, or degenerative encephalopathy or due to the effect of medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction.  The presence of rare sharp waves from the right frontotemporal region is suggestive of underlying epileptogenicity of that region.  No seizures were captured.  An inpatient EEG monitoring session is recommended for further seizure evaluation.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel of EKG.  Despite the challenges of the ICU, impedances were okay.  The technologist did need to readjust some of the electrodes.  The patient was described as awake.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern.  At times there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  At other times, there are bursts of more rhythmic slowing identified bilaterally.  The bursts of rhythmic delta are a bit more prominent on the right than the left.  They are also a bit more prominent in the right posterior quadrant.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The EEG was recorded during awake and stage I sleep. Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 10 Hz frequency and 30-50 microvolts in amplitude which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There is frequent focal slowing seen at F7-T3 with 2-4 Hz frequency and 20-40 microvolts amplitude.  There area frequent F7-T3 sharp waves seen with some having large spread to F3.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 7-8 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is presence of low-amplitude diffuse beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  There is 6-7 Hz excess theta activity during wakefulness.  Stage 1 sleep is characterized by disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm, slowing of the background and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and posts. Stage 2 sleep is characterized by presence of k- complexes and sleep spindles. There are occasional bursts of right temporal and central slowing, most pronounced in mid temporal region at T3 during wakefulness and sleep mixed with sharply contoured delta waves lasting for 1-3 seconds with no evolution.  During wakefulness and sleep, there are occasional bursts of generalized spike and wave discharges seen appearing with a frequency of 2.5-3 Hz, which were frontally predominant.  These occurred in bursts lasting from 1-3 seconds.  There was no clinical seizure correlate during these bursts.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response without any photoparoxysmal response.  Hyperventilation was performed and resulted in diffuse slowing of the background activity.  Heart rate was 72 beats per minutes.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through stage 2 sleep, due to:
Generalized spike and slow wave discharges seen during wakefulness and sleep with a frequency of 2.5-3 Hz with no evolution.
Disorganized background
Excess theta activity during wakefulness and slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
Right central and mid temporal slowing mixed with sharply contoured wave discharges.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm and excess theta activity are consistent with encephalopathy, which could be due to toxic, metabolic, infectious, medication induced, degenerative, postictal, or bilateral cerebral dysfunction. Occasional bursts of frontally predominant generalized spike and slow wave discharges and right central and temporal slowing and sharply contoured delta waves are consistent with underlying epileptogenicity with multiple foci. The generalized beta activity could be due to medication effect including benzodiazepine, barbiturate, or could be due to anxiety or hyperthyroidism. Clinical correlation and repeat EEG or prolonged EEG monitoring for further evolution is recommended.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 42-year-old woman with a history of seizures.  She has been seizure-free since August 2012.  Over the past 3 weeks the patient has been having issues with depth perception, stumbling backward, falls, vertigo and slurred speech.  A pacemaker was inserted in 2003.
MEDICATIONS:  Her medications include Dilantin, Topamax, Neurontin, morphine, atenolol, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and single EKG lead. Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation  was performed
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  During maximal wakefulness the posterior dominant rhythm reaches 8.5 Hz, alpha activity that attenuates with eye opening.  The anterior to posterior frequency gradient is weak.  Additionally, polymorphic theta activity is captured.  Drowsiness is characterized by the attenuation of the posterior dominant rhythm and bursts of theta and delta activity.  Intermittent polymorphic theta and delta activity are captured over the bitemporal regions, left greater than right.  This activity is independent from each other.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 21 minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing, intermittent bitemporal mild to moderate focal slowing, left greater than right.  Diffuse cerebral slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific cerebral dysfunction.   Focal bitemporal slowing is suggestive of underlying focal cerebral dysfunction, possible structural in etiology.

MEDICATIONS:  Ultram, Zocor, Procardia, Aldactone, Namenda.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low amplitude 11 Hz activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with gaster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, symmetrical vertex wave and sleep spindles are captured.  Intermittent polymorphic theta activity is captured over the right temporal regions.  A brief run of simple intermittent rhythmic delta activity (TIRDA) is observed over the left temporal region.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a heart rate of fewer than 60 beats a minute.
FINDINGS:
Intermittent mild bitemporal slowing.
Single run of left TIRDA.

No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and briefly asleep 20-minute EEG due to occasional mild bitemporal slowing as well as a short run of left temporal rhythmic delta activity.  Bitemporal slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  Focal rhythmic left temporal slow activity probably indicates focal left temporal cerebral dysfunction, and if clinical suspicion for seizures persists, this pattern could indicate a potential epileptogenic focus emanating from the left temporal region.  No electrographic seizures were observed.  Sinus bradycardia is noted on single EKG lead. Excess beta could be secondary to medication effect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  The sharp waves were in the region of the patient's craniotomy.  This patient's medications and critical illness as well
as her past neurological history may all contribute to the pattern described above.  No seizures were recorded.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 38-year-old woman with history of seizure and memory loss having auras and staring, having the last one a week ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.  Hyperventilation accentuated the left anterior temporal focal slowing, which I will describe in abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:  Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV intermittently throughout the recording.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate:  72.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.

MEDICATIONS:  Carbatrol and gabapentin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using a standard 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to one channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness and drowsiness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior rhythm was slow in 7.5-8 Hz in frequency and 40-45 microvolts in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates somehow with eye opening.  There was diffuse theta activity seen during wakefulness most pronounced on the right side, 5-6 Hz in frequency.  Drowsiness was characterized by slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm, absence of motion and eye blink artifact.  There was breach rhythm seen in the right cerebral hemisphere most pronounced in the right posterior quadrant at times with occasional sharply contoured features.  There were frequent bursts of polymorphic theta and delta activity seen at bifrontal region most pronounced in superior frontal areas at F3 and F4 lasting 1-2 seconds.  There were also occasional sharp waves seen arising from the right temporal regions at T4/T6 during wakefulness without evolution.  There were rare epileptiform discharges arising from left posterior quadrant with no evolution. Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and resulted in no driving response.  Heart rate was 60 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to:
Generalized slowing of background activity and slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm during wakefulness, most pronounced on the right side.
Breach rhythm in the right posterior quadrant region.
Intermittent polymorphic delta and theta activity at times with sharply contoured features in frontotemporal regions bilaterally.
Occasional sharp waves seen arising from the right temporal region and rarely from left temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Generalized slowing of the background activity and posterior rhythm (most pronounced in the right cerebral hemisphere) during wakefulness could be due to toxic, metabolic, or infectious encephalopathy.  It could also be due to sedating medication or bilateral cerebral dysfunction with structural lesion in the right cerebral hemisphere.  Breach rhythm is consistent with patient's history of craniotomy.  Occasional polymorphic theta and delta activity seen in bifrontal region and right posterior quadrant are suggestive of an underlying structural abnormality in the subcortical white matter in this regions.  The sharp waves seen arising from the right temporal region and rarely in left posterior quadrant region are suggestive of epileptogenicity of the temporal region in these areas. Clinical correlation is recommended.

CONDITION OF RECORDING:  The recording is performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient is a 53-year-old woman with past medical history for 17 years, with last seizures in May and June, with associated generalized convulsion and urinary incontinence.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote and phenobarbital.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no clear posterior dominant rhythm and no clear anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  During maximal wakefulness, the background consists of somewhat monomorphic moderate amplitude 8 Hz theta activity admixed with polymorphic delta activity.  During periods of quiescence, POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), bursts of delta, and periods of possible brief slow-wave sleep are captured.  Frequent bursts of variable lengths of polymorphic sharply contoured theta and delta activity are captured.  This slowing is multifocal, but most pronounced over the left temporal region.  Hyperventilation is performed with poor effort and does not result in additional abnormalities.  Step photic stimulation does not result in significant change in the background.
FINDINGS:
Mild to moderate diffuse slowing and disorganization.
Bursts of multifocal slowing, often sharply contoured, most pronounced over the left temporal region.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 21-minute awake and asleep electroencephalogram due to mild to moderate diffuse slowing and disorganization and multifocal bursts of sharply contoured slowing, most pronounced over the left temporal region.  Diffuse slowing and disorganization indicates etiologically a nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No clear epileptiform discharges were identified.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 47-year-old woman who presents with follow up for catamenial epilepsy, status post right temporal lobectomy, now seizure free.  Complains of headaches for the past 1 to 2 months, right frontal, as well as some forgetfulness with only a severe headache once.
MEDICATIONS:  Carbamazepine and levetiracetam.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta which is slightly higher in amplitude and frequency over the right frontotemporal hemisphere.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Single focal sharp waves seen over C4/F4 in wakefulness.
Focal slow waves at T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-40 microvolts seen continuously with increased amplitude over the left hemisphere consistent with a breached rhythm.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  60.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to single right frontocentral sharp wave in addition to right mid temporal continuous focal slowing and breach.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures possibly arising from the right central frontal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral structural dysfunction in the right midtemporal region, which is consistent with a known temporal lobectomy.  No seizures were seen.  Please note that this EEG is similar to ones performed on April 5, 2012 as well as the one performed on October 22, 2012 with the exception that the sharp waves seen today appear to be more central frontal rather than temporal.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and stage I sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  This was seen best over the left hemisphere.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation, produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and stage I sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen almost continuously over the right hemisphere, maximal at T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz, and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Focal slow waves seen occasionally at T3 and independently at C3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  At times, there were sharply contoured.
Heart rate 60.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right continuous mid temporal slowing in addition to occasional left mid temporal and central slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction over the right mid temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left mid temporal and central region, all of which are likely related to the known strokes.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.

Other more significant seizures with tonic-clonic activity.  Onset in 2003.  Previous EEG monitoring for nasal tingling and distal paresthesias.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat, phenytoin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Impedances were acceptable aside from T1 and T2.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.
There are a handful of subtle, underlying abnormalities.  These include a rare, discrete right temporal sharp wave with unusual field of spread, but when reviewed with an average reference, it is maximal on the right with a field involving the left (transverse dipole?) .  In addition, there is a suggestion of low voltage fast activity noted on the left.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.  Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Discrete right temporal sharp waves with an unusual field of spread.
Subtle, fast activity or a low voltage spike in the left frontal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to this patient's previous EEGs spanning 2003 to the present, both of these findings have been identified in the past.  The left frontal activity was noted during the patient's long-term video EEG monitoring, and the right temporal findings, although rare for this patient, have been noted since 2003.
