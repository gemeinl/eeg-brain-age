INTRODUCTION:  A 38-year-old right-handed woman with epilepsy, current seizureÂ­
free.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Digital video EEG is performed using standard
10/20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation. This is an awake through stage II sleep record in an individual who is very drowsy.
In maximum wakefulness there is an 8.8 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the alpha rhythm. Vertex waves are noted in sleep, as are post.
Hyperventilation produces a small degree of background slowing. The patient is falling asleep in photic stimulation.
Heart rate 60 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits but excessively drowsy patient.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are noted. The excessive drowsiness can be due to sleep deprivations, medications or a warm environment.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is well organized with a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Photic stimulation elicits driving. After photic stimulation is over, the patient had some jerking of her shoulders but not in association with the flashing lights. After the photic stimulation continues, the recording continues and the patient had intermittent jerking of her shoulders. The shoulders jerk forwards and backwards.

The shoulder jerking is not associated with epileptiform activity in the EEG. It is sometimes associated with upwards thrusting of her upper chest. She stares straight ahead during the events.

As the record continues, a physician examines the patient. The interaction with the physician and the patient is associated with increasing motor activity including eye blinking, mouth opening and closing, a little bit of alternating movements to right or left, and then some rotatory movements of the torso. When the movements stop, the EEG shows a normal awake pattern. The patient is staring off to space after the event ends.

The event begins at 9:58 and lasts 7 minutes. Afterwards, there is intermittent jerking. Cognitive testing is not performed to make certain that the patient is responsive at the end of the EEG.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake through stage 2 sleep in a very drowsy individual.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall alpha rhythm is relatively low voltage, 12 Hz. Rhythmic temporal theta of drowsiness characteristic 5-6 Hz is identified in the transition to sleep. Vertex waves and spindles are noted. The patient continues to have eye movement into stage 2 sleep. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is falling back into stage 2 sleep, but does elicit scant driving.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are a number of normal variants in the EEG, including rhythmic temporal theta of drowsiness. The overall background is very low voltage and there is generous beta. The generous beta may be due to the use of benzodiazepines. The low voltage background is not pathological in and of itself.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm.  On some occasions, the alpha rhythm is a little higher amplitude activity on the left than the right.  There is a bit of head rocking activity on the right compared to the left.  Hyperventilation is performed early in the record, producing an increase in theta.  Following this, as the patient becomes drowsy, the EEG is a bit more synchronous with higher amplitude and more anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Although there is some head rocking artifact in the background, there are no definitive focal or epileptiform features.  Given the head rocking artifact, a followup study, capturing extended sleep may be helpful in
characterizing epileptiform activity.  Alternatively, comparison with previous studies may also be valuable.

At about 3:32 a.m. the patient suddenly started having diffuse body shaking and rocking, as well as facial twitching.  This was much more severe than the other ones.  She continued rocking, jerking, and being unresponsive.  Then after stopping the jerking she laid in bed and remained unresponsive and started moving her mouth rhythmically in a chewing fashion.  The whole event lasted for about 4.5 minutes.
The EEG during the whole 3 events revealed a normal posterior dominant rhythm and no epileptiform correlate to any of the events.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG and 3 non-epileptic events.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and sleep EEG.  Note:  The 3 events described above did not have an EEG correlate which is consistent with a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long term EEG monitoring was performed at bedside for 4.5 hours using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were performed.  Continuous spike detection software, as well as seizure detection software, as well as patient alarm events, and nurses notes were used to review the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm with normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
Events:  The patient had about 9 events which consisted of him pressing the alarm, suddenly his arms would become flexed, and he would become stiff and grimacing his face, lasting for about 20-30 seconds, during the episode and after which he would be unresponsive for another 2-3 minutes.  The behavior was very similar to the ones that he described before and every episode remained the same.  During these episodes the EEG would have a diffuse muscle artifact, but underlying it there would be a normal posterior dominant rhythm and no epileptiform discharges prior to the flexing, posturing, or after when he would remain unresponsive.  It looked like a normal EEG.  Sometimes with the flexor posturing he would hip thrust during the event.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG with events with no EEG correlate.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The events that were captured and described as above had no EEG correlate and are consistent with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.  No epileptiform discharges were seen.

MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Percocet,
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm of 40 mV.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record producing an increase in theta, following this the patient becomes drowsy with attenuation of the alpha rhythm and an increase in both beta and theta.  Vertex waves are noted in stage I sleep.  Vertex waves are slightly asymmetric.
In stage I and stage II sleep frontal beta is quite prominent. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta.  The patient is drifting into and out of stage II sleep during photic stimulation, which does not otherwise activate the record.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits in wakefulness through stage II sleep.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, a low voltage, but normal awake adult pattern is identified with a low voltage 9 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record increasing the amplitude of the background and providing a small amount of slowing.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta as well as some rhythmic theta.  Vertex waves and POSTs are identified in sleep, as are brief spindles.  Sleep is not sustained.  The patient is falling asleep during photic stimulation.  There is a scant driving response.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel  EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy EEG.  It was an extended study in an attempt to obtain sleep, completing 40 minutes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm at 40 microvolts with generous, frontocentral beta activity.  Wicket activity is noted as is rhythmic temporal theta of drowsiness.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta.  Photic stimulation produces bilateral driving.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Given the normal variant identified above, a repeat study capturing deeper stages of sleep would be helpful to search for epileptiform features in this patient with newly diagnosed epilepsy.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz 50 mV alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta. Brief fragments of stage I sleep include vertex waves, followed by arousal.
Photic stimulation is performed as the patient is starting to transition in and out of sleep and does not significantly activate the record. Hyperventilation produces a small increase in amplitude of the background.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were observed.  Sleep deprivation might produce the changes described above.
LONG TERM MONITORING - # 12-72 â 06/19/2012 to 06/20/2012
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient recalls 3 episodes.  The first is on the 19th at noon where she felt a little startled.  The second was at 10 p.m. where she felt a mini aura characterized by tingling sensation on her face.  She did not recall an episode at 5:25, although she did push the button for a tingling sensation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Random wakefulness and sleep includes a well-organized 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta activity.
Event time 11:22:  There is a burst of rhythmic left temporal theta delta with frequency evolution.  This is 5 seconds in duration.  There is no push button at that time.
Event time 5:25:20 p.m.:   A burst of rhythmic theta, frequency was subtle, frequency evolution lasting only 3 seconds.  Thirty seconds later the patient reports the mini-aura which she no longer recalled.
Event time 9:58 p.m.  No abnormalities on the EEG were identified at that time.
Event time10:25 a.m.:  There was another burst lasting 4 seconds in duration in the morning on the 20th which is similar to the 2 prior bursts.   No clinical features were recalled.
HR:    60 bpm
INTERVAL IMPRESSION:  There are 3 bursts of rhythmic theta from the left temporal region with frequency evolution.  These are concerning as a potential interictal epileptiform discharge.  They may also be clinically significant with the mini-auras that the patient experienced.
LONG TERM MONITORING - # 12- 72 â 06/20/2012 TO 06/21/2012
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a well defined 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  This is a sleep deprived record.  Around 10:00 p.m. the patient seems to be trying to stay up.  The EEG demonstrates small EPOCHS where the patient seems to be drowsy.   Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K-complexes, and spindles. The data is reviewed for the clinical symptoms that the patient experienced, but no epileptiform features are identified.
HR:    66 bpm
LONG TERM MONITORING - # 12-72 â 06/21/2012 TO 06/22/2012
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient reported an aura at 8 p.m. on the 21st.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Around 8 p.m., the patient is noted to transition in and out of stage 2 sleep, waking up and falling back asleep.  Fragments of deeper stages of sleep are noted overnight.
No electrographic seizures were identified.  The seizure and spike detector did not identify any other epileptiform abnormalities.
Event time 11:55:  The patient pushes the button at 11:56:12 stating that she feels as if she is about to have an aura.  She puts her hand to her chest and later appears to be tearful.  The EEG is awake at this time.  No epileptiform features were noted.   For her 8:00 p.m. the patient reported symptoms that her throat was closing with the seizure.

HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for:
3 bursts of rhythmic, paroxysmal theta, all less than 4 seconds in duration, but with frequency evolution.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's clinical symptoms did not appear to be associated with well-defined epileptiform abnormalities.  On one day, however, there were discharges which appear epileptiform in nature.  While this patient did not have any of her larger spells with head turning, a feeling as if her throat was closing or impairment of awareness, this record does not exclude a diagnosis and clinically, diagnosis may be considered.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta.  The drowsy pattern is relatively symmetric and on rare occasions, the slow activity seems to be slightly slower on the right compared to the left.  This is more apparent with the use of frequency analysis.  Hyperventilation produces bilateral theta.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous, bilateral driving with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.  There is vigorous harmonic driving and supraharmonic driving identified from both hemispheres.  The driving response is higher amplitude on the left compared to the right, but the overall frequency differences are relatively symmetric.  On some occasions, the supraharmonic driving seems to be bit a more prominent on the right.

MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Elavil
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Mu activity, as well as lambda was identified. The patient appears to be very sleepy, transitions in and out of stage II sleep.  Spindle activity is noted.  There seem to be fragments of sleep spindles just as she is dropping almost in and out wakefulness.  As the sleep record continues, more abundant stage II sleep is identified, but in the transition in and out of stage II sleep, there are fragments of early drowsiness, almost emerging into a stage II sleep pattern. The patient is awakened at the end of the test and answers complex questions. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:   66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Somewhat unusual, but normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no epileptiform features, but there are multiple normal variants, including mu and rhythmic temporal theta of drowsiness. Given the transitions noted early in the record between wakefulness and stage II sleep, an underlying sleep deficit may account for this.  If there is any other question, a follow up study when the patient has had adequate sleep may be of value.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  The patient's impedances were inappropriate, specifically in the occipital electrodes which caused some multi-electrode artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that appears to reach 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient had some normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures did not produce any abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep, stage I/stage II.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
One single sharp transient maximal at F3 seen in the recording while drowsy.
Occasional small amplitude sharp spikes seen at T3, only in stage I sleep, although not seen over T2.  The morphology is most consistent with benign epileptiform transients of sleep (BETS).
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal limited EEG with one suspicious left frontal sharp transient and BETS.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The significance of the left frontal sharp transient is unclear.  A repeated recording should be performed.  Particularly in this patient where the impedances and the quality of the recording was poor, it should be repeated free of charge.  The BETS are benign and do not indicate a high correlation with an epileptogenic focus in that region.

Fast alpha variant is observed.  There is a well preserved anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies and lower amplitude anteriorly.  Excess beta activity is observed.  Very brief drowsiness is captured at the end of the recording and characterized by increase in the amount of diffuse beta.
Hyperventilation produces no change in the background.
Photic stimulation results in appropriate photic driving at multiple frequencies.
Other:  Occasional EKG artifact is captured.  Regular sinus rhythm is observed on a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:  Normal awake and very briefly drowsy EEG.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and briefly drowsy 22-minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges are captured, however, stage 2 sleep is not recorded.  If clinical suspicion for seizures remains, a repeat study with stage 2 sleep may be of benefit.  A
lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not exclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the laboratory using the standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement, in addition to T1 and T2 electrodes and 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through stage II sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 10.5 to 11.5 Hz in frequency, 30-40 microvolts in amplitude seen in the occipital region which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Stage I sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact, as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and POSTS.  Stage II sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  Hyperventilation results in symmetrical slowing of the background activity.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate was 70 to 80 beats per minute and regular.

INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.   Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 10-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Excessive diffuse beta is observed.
During sleep symmetrical vertex waves are captured.
Hyperventilation produces a mild diffuse background slowing.
Step photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 22 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, the patient's sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persist, a repeat study with the patient asleep may be of benefit.  Excess beta could be secondary to medication effects, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.

DIAGNOSIS:  Rule out seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 49-year-old male with a history of seizures and hypertension presents with seizure-like activities described as acting weird, staring, confusion, and EMS noted generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  The patient's medications include phenobarbital and Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the lab using the standard international 10/20 system of electrode placement in addition to 1-channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through a stage II sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 8.5-9 Hz in frequency and 30-35 microvolts in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is 6-7 Hz diffuse theta activity seen during wakefulness.  There is presence of low amplitude diffuse beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Stage I sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm and slowing of the background activity and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact as well as the presence of the vertex sharp waves.  Stage II sleep was captured characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles. Heart rate was 90-100 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to excess theta activity during wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings could be due to toxic metabolic hypoxic or infectious encephalopathy, alternatively it could be due to the effect of sedating medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  The generalized beta activity could be due to medication effect including phenobarbital or hyperthyroidism.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No epileptiform discharges abnormalities or seizures were captured during this record.  If clinically indicated, a repeat sleep deprived EEG or continuous bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.  The absence of epileptiform activities or seizures does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was attempted in the laboratory using standard a 10-20 System of electrode placement, with 1 channel of EKG.  Significant technical difficulties included the hair weaves that the patient has.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Despite the problems with electrode placement and impedance, the background EEG is appropriately organized, with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  The referential montage was not particularly successful.  Features of drowsiness included an increase in background slowing.  In addition, very brief stage I sleep was seen, with vertex waves and then a transition in and out of stage I sleep.  At the very close of the record, the patient was transitioning in and out of stage II sleep.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.  Heart rate 84 bpm, occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging but normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The transitions in and out of stage II sleep may reflect sleep deprivation or an underlying sleep disturbance, which could be correlated with this patient's clinical picture.  To obtain a better quality EEG, a repeat study, when the patient has had her hair weaves removed, is suggested.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is an excessive amount of beta throughout the recording.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
The heart rate is 54.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
EPISODES:
During the recording as photic stimulation was being performed the patient started stuttering and her right arm started shaking and trembling for a period of 11 minutes.  The patient is responsive throughout the whole period; however, the code word which she was asked to memorize and later asked to repeat was repeated incorrectly at the end of the event.  During this event the EEG appeared to be normal with no epileptiform activity seen or EEG correlate seen.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  The episode described above, which started on with the right arm shaking did not reveal any EEG correlate, as such it may represent a nonepileptic event or alternatively it may be a simple partial seizure, which in up to 75% of the cases do not have any EEG correlate.  Lastly, please note that the excessive beta noted on the EEG may be due to a medication effect.

Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges. During photic stimulation, there are at 19 and 21 Hz some 1.5 second bursts of frontal maximal sharply contoured theta. These discharges did not evolve but are suspicious for a fragmented photoparoxysmal response (PPR). The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.
Abnormal discharges:  None.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate:  102.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy electroencephalogram.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen. However, the discharges described above are suspicious for a PPR which can be seen in idiopathic generated epilepsy. Clinical correlation is recommended.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using a standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm was 9-9.5 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is diffuse low amplitude beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  Hyperventilation results in mild symmetrical slowing of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in symmetric driving response.  Heart rate was 60 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through drowsiness.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of the sleep may be helpful.  The generalized beta activity could be due to medication effect including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or could be due to anxiety or hypothyroidism.  Clinical correlation is recommended.

Apparently she fainted and was on the floor for 15 seconds and then was observed to shake.  Of note, during the recording here in the laboratory, there was a brief episode of right hemibody tingling.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The recording start time was 11:29 a.m.  The recording end time was 12 noon.  The recording length was 25 minutes.
As the record opens there is a well formed and symmetric 9-10 Hz  posterior dominant rhythm that is reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of frontal central beta activity that is symmetrically distributed.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm.  At approximately 11:45 a.m., approximately 15 minutes into the recording epic, the patient complained of right hemibody tingling and numbness.  She was examined by the physician in the laboratory at the time, and there were no obvious clinical sequela.  During this time, there was no change in the background cerebral activity of the EEG.
Hyperventilation was performed for 3 minutes with good effort and failed to activate the tracing.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and induced a very reactive and responsive photic driving response at intermediate flash frequency ranges.  The patient's heart rate ranged from 70-90 beats during the record epic.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG capturing wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does no rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  The brief clinical event of right hemibody numbness and tingling were not associated with changes in the background cerebral activity.  Thus, this event is likely a nonepileptic event.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the laboratory using the standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to T1 and T2 electrodes and 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through stage 1 sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 9-10 Hz seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  A stage 1 sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and posts.  Hyperventilation results in symmetrical slowing of the background activity.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate is 60 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through stage 1 sleep.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG, does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was quite drowsy and the EEG opened in stage II sleep.
TECHNICAL NOTES:  The patient had a very tender scalp, had difficulty tolerating the test, and optimal impedances could not be obtained, but technical quality was otherwise satisfactory.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In stage II sleep, there are vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and posts.  The technologist alerts the patient for hyperventilation, producing an alpha rhythm of 9 Hz.  Hyperventilation does not otherwise activate the record and the patient drifts in and out of stage II sleep with multiple brief arousals.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response despite the fact that the patient was drifting off to sleep.
Heart rate: 60 beats per minute.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
The patient is a 71-year-old man who had an episode of loss of consciousness after a coughing spell.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  The recording was performed at the laboratory.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include amlodipine, Lantus, lovastatin and others.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated low  amplitude 10.5-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitude anteriorly.  A faster alpha variant is occasionally observed.  During periods of sleep symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes are captured.  Additionally, brief bursts of bitemporal delta are observed during sleep as well.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and does not result in significant changes in background.  __________ photic stimulation results in simple driving and multiple flash frequencies.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a heart rate as low as 36 beats a minute during sleep and approximately 60 beats a minute during wakefulness.
FINDINGS:
Profound bradycardia with heart rate as low as 36 beats a minute during sleep.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
TECHNICAL:  The patient appears to be somewhat tense.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  During much of the EEG, there is a little bit more relaxed wakefulness with slowing of the alpha rhythm to 8.5 Hz.  Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in beta.  Other features of drowsiness include rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness with vertex waves noted in stage I sleep.
During hyperventilation and in relaxed wakefulness, there are 2 simple sharp waves.  During hyperventilation the simple sharp waves are more clearly defined after going slow wave.
Photic stimulation was remarkable for prominent beta and prominent, supraharmonic driving.
Additionally, hyperventilation was remarkable for a fair amount of muscle artifact.

IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within limits of normal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG demonstrated multiple, normal variants, some of which have the morphology of benign epileptiform discharges.  There is a single left mid to posterior temporal sharp wave.  In that there is only one discharge, this must be considered artifactual.  The generous beta described above may be due to this patient's medications.
If an underlying seizure disorder is an important consideration, a followup study with more prolonged sleep is suggested.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 23-year-old man with a history of headaches and dizziness for 2 days as well as slight tremors.
MEDICATIONS:  Oxycodone, lorazepam, Tylenol, and Lovenox.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well-formed and modulated 11 to 11.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at low amplitudes anteriorly.  Excess diffuse beta is captured.  During sleep there are symmetrical and vertex waves, sleep spindles and K complexes were observed.   Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and results in mild diffuse background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation does not result in any change in the background.
FINDINGS:
Stage 2 sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
Excess beta.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 29 minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  The excess beta could be secondary to medication effects such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.

MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was an awake and asleep record.
TECHNICAL:  Impedances for most of the electrodes were satisfactory, but this EEG was problematic with a great degree of muscle artifact when the patient was awake.  As the patient went off to sleep, there was still muscle artifact picked up in the left scalp electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Despite the problems described above, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of focal frontal central beta.  Wicket was noted as the patient became drowsy.  Other features with drowsiness include rhythmic central theta.  The electrode artifact did not drop out in stage I sleep with vertex waves.  Brief stage II sleep included vertex waves with spindles.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation was remarkable for a great deal of muscle artifact.  Heart rate 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a technically challenging but otherwise normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The wicket is a normal finding.  Given the degree of muscle artifact described above, a follow-up study capturing perhaps more prolonged
sleep or with other mechanisms to alleviate the muscle artifact is suggested.  Alternatively, comparison with this individual's childhood EEGs may be of value.
