INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1channel EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This is a very drowsy patient but in wakefulness, there is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm, slowing to 7 Hz in drowsiness. The overall background is symmetric, but on one occasion there is a bit more rhythmic slowing on the left compared to the right in transition to sleep. Photic stimulation: The driving response is elicited which is a bit more vigorous on the right than the left although it is present bilaterally.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Very modest background slowing.
2. A burst of rhythmic slowing on the left.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing is nonspecific and could be due to this patient's medications or CNS problems. Although no epileptiform features were identified, correlation with imaging is suggested. If more information Is needed about this patient's epilepsy, an EEG monitoring session should be considered.

MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in rhythmicity of the background as well as anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  A single burst of paroxysmal rhythmic slowing is noted if the patient transitions to sleep but then photic stimulation is performed. The rare bursts of hypersynchronous slowing are noted in photic stimulation, but unfortunately this does seem to collide with the attempt to capture sleep.

Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic central theta followed by vertex waves and spindles.  There is a slight asymmetry noted in the frontocentral regions, which could be attributed to electrode placement.  Prominent posts were noted in sleep.  Hyperventilation produced some increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicited vigorous bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  68 BPM.
Occasional head rocking artifact was noted.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in the record.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration, a repeat study capturing deeper stages of sleep using sleep deprivation may be of use.  Alternatively, comparison with this patient's childhood EEGs might also be helpful.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 61-year-old man with a recent pontine hemorrhage, now with worsening mental status since this a.m., 01/02/2013.  EEG is performed since there is a possibility of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol, Colace, ciprofloxacin, nystatin.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  Voltages are diffusely low.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the left hemisphere consists of low amplitude 8-9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient over the left hemisphere with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  There is nearly continuous EMG artifact over the right hemispheric leads that obscures most of the right hemispheric recording.  No sleep architecture is observed.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
FINDINGS:
Nearly continuous EMG artifact over the right hemispheric leads that obscures those leads.  This EMG artifact makes interpretation of the activity over the right hemisphere not reliable.
No clear epileptiform discharges.
No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake only 22-minute EEG.  There is nearly continuous EMG artifact over the right hemispheric leads that obscures significant portions of the recording over the right hemispheric leads.  Therefore, interpretation of the background over the right hemisphere is not reliable.  If concern for seizures persists, a repeat study with less EMG artifact may be of benefit.  No clear electrographic seizures are captured.

REASON FOR STUDIES:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 33-year-old right handed woman presents with history of seizures since March 2011 described as an aura, a metallic taste, loss of consciousness, tongue biting, bladder incontinence, afterwards confused for hours.  Last seizure was on Saturday.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, clonazepam, tramadol, Advair, albuterol, sertraline, Sudafed, amantadine, Motrin, temazepam.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is an excessive amount of beta throughout the recording.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
The heart rate is 54.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
EPISODES:
During the recording as photic stimulation was being performed the patient started stuttering and her right arm started shaking and trembling for a period of 11 minutes.  The patient is responsive throughout the whole period; however, the code word which she was asked to memorize and later asked to repeat was repeated incorrectly at the end of the event.  During this event the EEG appeared to be normal with no epileptiform activity seen or EEG correlate seen.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  The episode described above, which started on with the right arm shaking did not reveal any EEG correlate, as such it may represent a nonepileptic event or alternatively it may be a simple partial seizure, which in up to 75% of the cases do not have any EEG correlate.  Lastly, please note that the excessive beta noted on the EEG may be due to a medication effect.

MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The recording start time was 11:29 a.m.  The recording end time was 12 noon.  The recording length was 25 minutes.
As the record opens there is a well formed and symmetric 9-10 Hz  posterior dominant rhythm that is reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of frontal central beta activity that is symmetrically distributed.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm.  At approximately 11:45 a.m., approximately 15 minutes into the recording epic, the patient complained of right hemibody tingling and numbness.  She was examined by the physician in the laboratory at the time, and there were no obvious clinical sequela.  During this time, there was no change in the background cerebral activity of the EEG.
Hyperventilation was performed for 3 minutes with good effort and failed to activate the tracing.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and induced a very reactive and responsive photic driving response at intermediate flash frequency ranges.  The patient's heart rate ranged from 70-90 beats during the record epic.

MEDICATIONS:  Divalproate, diltiazem.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  There was a impedance problem at T3-T4 which could not be fixed.  The patient was tense and was unable to relax during the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a background rhythm of 9 Hz frequency with an amplitude of 40-70 microvolts which was reactive to eye opening.  The amplitude on the left was slightly higher than the right.  The background was occasionally disrupted because of chewing and muscle artifact.
Sleep was not achieved during the recording.
Photic stimulation elicited driving at intermediate/frequencies.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were no focal or generalized epileptiform features noted.  The asymmetry in alpha rhythm is not clinically significant.  We do not have previous EEGs for comparison.  A repeat EEG capturing sleep may be performed to increase the probability of finding epileptogenic activity.
