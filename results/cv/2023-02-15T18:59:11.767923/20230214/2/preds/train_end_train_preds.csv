INTRODUCTION:  A 38-year-old right-handed woman with epilepsy, current seizureÂ­
free.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Digital video EEG is performed using standard
10/20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation. This is an awake through stage II sleep record in an individual who is very drowsy.
In maximum wakefulness there is an 8.8 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the alpha rhythm. Vertex waves are noted in sleep, as are post.
Hyperventilation produces a small degree of background slowing. The patient is falling asleep in photic stimulation.
Heart rate 60 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits but excessively drowsy patient.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are noted. The excessive drowsiness can be due to sleep deprivations, medications or a warm environment.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is almost entirely asleep record. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. At some points, behaviorally, the patient appears to the technologist to be awake but the EEG suggests that she is sleepy.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The vast majority of this record demonstrates stage II sleep with vertex waves, spindles and K complexes. Brief eye opening with what seems to be an awake state is more compatible with a drowsy state followed quickly by the appearance of vertex activity. In this bedside portable record, there is some artifact and a little asymmetry seen intermittently at CZ/C4.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Additional clinical information is important to determine the cause of the patient's excessive drowsiness. Because bf the artifact noted at CZ and C4, consider a repeat study in the lab is advised.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a well-defined 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a background rich in beta frequency activity. Some sections of the record demonstrate prominent Mu rhythm although testing is not performed to confirm this. As the patient becomes drowsy, rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness is observed. This can be identified from the right or the left temporal regions. Other features of drowsiness include increase in beta. Photic stimulation is performed as the patient is finally drifting off to sleep with a scant driving response identified.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Mu rhythm and rhythmic state of drowsiness are normal variants. No epileptiform features were seen. The generous theta may be due to this patient's medications.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm of 50 microvolts with a small amount of l ow voltage frontocentral beta activity. A small amount of background theta Is noted which attenuates when the patient is stimulated. Hyperventilation produces an increase in background theta.

MEDICATIONS: Alprazolam, Pantoprazole, Atenolol, Dilantin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is well organized with a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Photic stimulation elicits driving. After photic stimulation is over, the patient had some jerking of her shoulders but not in association with the flashing lights. After the photic stimulation continues, the recording continues and the patient had intermittent jerking of her shoulders. The shoulders jerk forwards and backwards.

The shoulder jerking is not associated with epileptiform activity in the EEG. It is sometimes associated with upwards thrusting of her upper chest. She stares straight ahead during the events.

As the record continues, a physician examines the patient. The interaction with the physician and the patient is associated with increasing motor activity including eye blinking, mouth opening and closing, a little bit of alternating movements to right or left, and then some rotatory movements of the torso. When the movements stop, the EEG shows a normal awake pattern. The patient is staring off to space after the event ends.

The event begins at 9:58 and lasts 7 minutes. Afterwards, there is intermittent jerking. Cognitive testing is not performed to make certain that the patient is responsive at the end of the EEG.

HR: 60 bpm


IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This patient had a 7-minute behavioral episode without EEG change. This recording suggests a behavioral event rather than an electrical seizure.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the overall EEG is relatively low voltage with generous beta and scant alpha rhythms. A breech rhythm is noted in the right hemisphere. There is also some electrode artifact, compatible with a deformity of the skull shape.
Hyperventilation is performed early in the record, producing an increase in the amplitude, augmenting the double phase reversing artifacts on the right and increasing some theta a bit more so on the right compared to the left. Features of drowsiness included increase in beta. In drowsiness, the focal slowing is a bit more apparent on the right with a mixture of rhythmic 3-5 Hz activity. Vertex waves are noted as the patient transitions in and out of sleep. There is  disruption of faster frequency activity on the right in the transition to sleep in the centrotemporal regions with a bit more prominent spindles in the central regions, in the region of the previous
craniotomy. Overall, most of the focal slowing in this record is centrotemporal. In the context of a breech rhythm, there are a handful of right central or frontal sharp waves. Photic stimulation is  performed while the patient is in stage 2 sleep. No significant driving response was noted.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: A normal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic theta and delta activity in the right temporal region.
2. Rare G4 and F4 sharp waves identified in the context of a breech rhythm.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm.  On some occasions, the alpha rhythm is a little higher amplitude activity on the left than the right.  There is a bit of head rocking activity on the right compared to the left.  Hyperventilation is performed early in the record, producing an increase in theta.

Sleep is characterized by stage I. Activating procedures including photic stimulation and
hyperventilation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: During the recording, there are multiple bursts of prominent
frontal sharply contoured theta that appears to be maximal at the frontal polar electrodes. It
does not appear to clearly evolve and it only occurs interburst with no clinical correlate seen on
video. The significance of these discharges is unclear.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  Activating procedures and photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and sleep and normal stages I to III with sleep are recorded.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
Episodes:  The patient had 3 episodes throughout the recording.  The first one occurred at 12:34 p.m. at the onset of the recording where she started having left facial twitching, followed by unresponsiveness while continuing to have left facial twitching.  This event lasted for about 2 minutes and then the patient became reactive again.
The second event occurred at 8:18 p.m.  The patient suddenly started having left facial twitching and grimacing, as well as tightening her arms, as well as becoming unresponsive.  This was followed by staring and mouth movements.  The episode lasted for over 4 minutes.
At about 3:32 a.m. the patient suddenly started having diffuse body shaking and rocking, as well as facial twitching.  This was much more severe than the other ones.  She continued rocking, jerking, and being unresponsive.  Then after stopping the jerking she laid in bed and remained unresponsive and started moving her mouth rhythmically in a chewing fashion.  The whole event lasted for about 4.5 minutes.
The EEG during the whole 3 events revealed a normal posterior dominant rhythm and no epileptiform correlate to any of the events.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG and 3 non-epileptic events.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and sleep EEG.  Note:  The 3 events described above did not have an EEG correlate which is consistent with a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm with normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
Events:  The patient had about 9 events which consisted of him pressing the alarm, suddenly his arms would become flexed, and he would become stiff and grimacing his face, lasting for about 20-30 seconds, during the episode and after which he would be unresponsive for another 2-3 minutes.  The behavior was very similar to the ones that he described before and every episode remained the same.  During these episodes the EEG would have a diffuse muscle artifact, but underlying it there would be a normal posterior dominant rhythm and no epileptiform discharges prior to the flexing, posturing, or after when he would remain unresponsive.  It looked like a normal EEG.  Sometimes with the flexor posturing he would hip thrust during the event.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG with events with no EEG correlate.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The events that were captured and described as above had no EEG correlate and are consistent with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.  No epileptiform discharges were seen.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, a low voltage, but normal awake adult pattern is identified with a low voltage 9 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record increasing the amplitude of the background and providing a small amount of slowing.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta as well as some rhythmic theta.  Vertex waves and POSTs are identified in sleep, as are brief spindles.  Sleep is not sustained.

During photic stimulation there is some hypnagogic hypersynchrony as the patient starts to become drowsy.  Other features of drowsiness include slow-rolling eye movements and an increase in beta. There is a single burst of slowing from the left hemisphere.
HR:    50 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Hypnagogic hypersynchrony is a normal finding.  The single burst of rhythmic slowing from the left is a nonspecific finding.  To more
completely characterize this patient's epilepsy, a more prolonged study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the EEG is well organized with a 9.5 Hz, 30 microvolt alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta followed by rhythmic frontocentral theta.  Vertex waves were noted in stage II sleep.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting off to sleep.  A bilateral driving response was noted.  Vertex waves phase reverse at CV but are slightly asymmetric.
HR:    50 bpm
IMPRESSION:   EEG is within normal limits in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  In this individual with relatively frequent and
significant seizures, consideration for a followup 1-hour sleep-deprived EEG or long-term EEG recording may be valuable.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in slowing in the background.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic slowing followed by vertex waves and posts.  Photic stimulation elicits a driving response as well as lambda.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study capturing deeper stages of sleep may be valuable.  There was a small amount of shifting slowing noted in hyperventilation, but this is not outside of the range of normal for age.

LONG TERM MONITORING - # 12-72 â 06/19/2012 to 06/20/2012
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient recalls 3 episodes.  The first is on the 19th at noon where she felt a little startled.  The second was at 10 p.m. where she felt a mini aura characterized by tingling sensation on her face.  She did not recall an episode at 5:25, although she did push the button for a tingling sensation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Random wakefulness and sleep includes a well-organized 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta activity.
Event time 11:22:  There is a burst of rhythmic left temporal theta delta with frequency evolution.  This is 5 seconds in duration.  There is no push button at that time.
Event time 5:25:20 p.m.:   A burst of rhythmic theta, frequency was subtle, frequency evolution lasting only 3 seconds.  Thirty seconds later the patient reports the mini-aura which she no longer recalled.
Event time 9:58 p.m.  No abnormalities on the EEG were identified at that time.
Event time10:25 a.m.:  There was another burst lasting 4 seconds in duration in the morning on the 20th which is similar to the 2 prior bursts.   No clinical features were recalled.
HR:    60 bpm
INTERVAL IMPRESSION:  There are 3 bursts of rhythmic theta from the left temporal region with frequency evolution.  These are concerning as a potential interictal epileptiform discharge.  They may also be clinically significant with the mini-auras that the patient experienced.
LONG TERM MONITORING - # 12- 72 â 06/20/2012 TO 06/21/2012
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a well defined 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  This is a sleep deprived record.  Around 10:00 p.m. the patient seems to be trying to stay up.  The EEG demonstrates small EPOCHS where the patient seems to be drowsy.   Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K-complexes, and spindles. The data is reviewed for the clinical symptoms that the patient experienced, but no epileptiform features are identified.
HR:    66 bpm
LONG TERM MONITORING - # 12-72 â 06/21/2012 TO 06/22/2012
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient reported an aura at 8 p.m. on the 21st.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Around 8 p.m., the patient is noted to transition in and out of stage 2 sleep, waking up and falling back asleep.  Fragments of deeper stages of sleep are noted overnight.
No electrographic seizures were identified.  The seizure and spike detector did not identify any other epileptiform abnormalities.
Event time 11:55:  The patient pushes the button at 11:56:12 stating that she feels as if she is about to have an aura.  She puts her hand to her chest and later appears to be tearful.  The EEG is awake at this time.  No epileptiform features were noted.   For her 8:00 p.m. the patient reported symptoms that her throat was closing with the seizure.

HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for:
3 bursts of rhythmic, paroxysmal theta, all less than 4 seconds in duration, but with frequency evolution.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's clinical symptoms did not appear to be associated with well-defined epileptiform abnormalities.  On one day, however, there were discharges which appear epileptiform in nature.  While this patient did not have any of her larger spells with head turning, a feeling as if her throat was closing or impairment of awareness, this record does not exclude a diagnosis and clinically, diagnosis may be considered.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta.  The drowsy pattern is relatively symmetric and on rare occasions, the slow activity seems to be slightly slower on the right compared to the left.  This is more apparent with the use of frequency analysis.  Hyperventilation produces bilateral theta.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous, bilateral driving with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.  There is vigorous harmonic driving and supraharmonic driving identified from both hemispheres.  The driving response is higher amplitude on the left compared to the right, but the overall frequency differences are relatively symmetric.  On some occasions, the supraharmonic driving seems to be bit a more prominent on the right.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Lamictal.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.  However, during the recording, there is some frontocentral theta that is slightly sharply contoured as well as some T6 sharply contoured theta not clearly epileptic.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that there are sharply contoured waveforms of unclear significance, likely not pathologic.  However, repeated EEG with capturing deeper stages of sleep may be beneficial.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was an awake and a sleep record in very drowsy individual.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm, exceeding 70 mV with posterior slow waves of youth.  In drowsiness there is hypersynchronous rhythmic higher amplitude theta frequency activity âhypnogogicâ, âhypersynchronyâ.  There were 1 or 2 points of head rocking artifact and there were 1-2 bursts which are slightly asynchronous. Hyperventilation produces hypersynchronous rhythmic high amplitude, somewhat sharply contoured theta frequency activity, but no definitive spike and wave activity. The patient transitions in and out of stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles.  Other features of drowsiness include the hypersynchronous rhythmic theta.
Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG demonstrates multiple normal variants for a young adult.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There was no definitive spike and wave activity, although hyperventilation did produce some rhythmic high amplitude theta.  There were a handful of slightly asynchronous bursts as the patient transitions to drowsiness.  If absence seizures are an important consideration, a repeat fasting EEG, perhaps with a second hyperventilation session maybe helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with additional T1 and T2 electrodes placed and an EKG electrode placed, as well.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of moderate amplitude, well regulated and modulated 11 to 12-Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies in lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Excess beta is observed throughout the recording.  During sleep, vertex waves, sleep spindles, K-complexes, and POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep) observed.  Hyperventilation produces bursts of diffuse theta.  Photic stimulation produces symmetric photic driving.  No epileptiform discharges are observed.  Normal heart rate is observed on the single EKG read.
FINDINGS:
Excess beta.
Sleep stage II and III.  No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal greater than 21-minute study, awake and asleep EEG.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  The patient's impedances were inappropriate, specifically in the occipital electrodes which caused some multi-electrode artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that appears to reach 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient had some normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures did not produce any abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep, stage I/stage II.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
One single sharp transient maximal at F3 seen in the recording while drowsy.
Occasional small amplitude sharp spikes seen at T3, only in stage I sleep, although not seen over T2.  The morphology is most consistent with benign epileptiform transients of sleep (BETS).
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal limited EEG with one suspicious left frontal sharp transient and BETS.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The significance of the left frontal sharp transient is unclear.  A repeated recording should be performed.  Particularly in this patient where the impedances and the quality of the recording was poor, it should be repeated free of charge.  The BETS are benign and do not indicate a high correlation with an epileptogenic focus in that region.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 71-year-old woman with a past medical history of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Not known.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.   Hyperventilation was noted performed.  Photic stimulation was  performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 10.5 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.
During sleep symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, and K-complexes are captured.  Intermittent independent and synchronous polymorphic theta and delta activity is captured over the bilateral temporal regions.
Hyperventilation is not performed.
Stepped photic stimulation results in appropriate occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
Occasional bilateral temporal slowing.
Phase II Sleep
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and sleep 22-minute EEG.  Occasional temporal slowing is not considered abnormal in patients of this age.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on the routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz 40 microvolt alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Prominent mu activity is noted with 8 Hz activity in the central regions particularly on the left although testing was not performed to confirm this.  Mu rhythm was also noted in the right central region as the recording continued.  Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  The overall EEG is relatively high voltage with a very prominent mu activity.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Drowsiness produces an increase in beta.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving.  In some sections of the record there is a question of an alpha sub-harmonic.
Heart rate 72 b.p.m.
IMPRESSION:  This is an interesting but normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient has an interesting but normal EEG including the mu activity and the alpha rhythm with the alpha supra-harmonic.  No epileptiform features were identified.  If additional information is needed to characterize this individual's epilepsy, a more prolonged study can be considered.  Although benzodiazepines were not listed in this patient's medications, benzodiazepines or other similar medications might account for the prominent beta noted in the record.

Past history of hypertension, asthma and a psychiatric illness.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, lisinopril, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was attempted in the laboratory using standard a 10-20 System of electrode placement, with 1 channel of EKG.  Significant technical difficulties included the hair weaves that the patient has.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Despite the problems with electrode placement and impedance, the background EEG is appropriately organized, with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  The referential montage was not particularly successful.  Features of drowsiness included an increase in background slowing.  In addition, very brief stage I sleep was seen, with vertex waves and then a transition in and out of stage I sleep.  At the very close of the record, the patient was transitioning in and out of stage II sleep.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.  Heart rate 84 bpm, occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging but normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The transitions in and out of stage II sleep may reflect sleep deprivation or an underlying sleep disturbance, which could be correlated with this patient's clinical picture.  To obtain a better quality EEG, a repeat study, when the patient has had her hair weaves removed, is suggested.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 60-year-old woman who presents with a history of dizzy spells, the most recent about 10 days ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Meclizine p.r.n., Pravachol, and amlodipine.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated low to moderate amplitude 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness, POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep) and vertex waves are captured.  Hyperventilation produces several bursts of diffuse polymorphic delta activity as well as mild symmetrical background slowing.  Photic stimulation results in occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  A single EKG lead reveals a regular heart rate.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 22-minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured; however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persists, a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

She had 2 such events.  The first seizure occurred on 12/25/2012.  Prior to the event, the patient stated that she had a headache.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Ativan, Keppra, Tylenol, and Lovenox.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 10.5 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Excess diffuse beta is present.  During sleep, POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, and K-complexes are captured.  Hyperventilation is performed with a good effort and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation results in bilateral symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:  1.	No epileptiform discharges
2.	stage II sleep.
3.   Excess Beta
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 23-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excess beta could be secondary to the medications such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  These findings were conveyed to the Neurology team at the time of the dictation.

During sleep, symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindle, and POSTS (posterior occipital sharp transients of sleep) are captured.  Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort and produces no change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  A regular heart rate with occasional premature atrial QRS complexes captured in a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Excess beta.
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 41-minute electroencephalogram.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on routine electroencephalogram does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excess beta could be secondary to the medication affect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  These findings were conveyed to the ordering physician at the time of this dictation.

Stage 1 sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm slowing of the background and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and posts.  Hyperventilation results in a symmetric slowing of the background activity.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate is 60 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through stage 1 sleep.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.

Photic stimulation elicited a driving response with harmonic and supra harmonic driving.  In addition, on occasion during photic stimulation, the patient was becoming drowsy with bursts of paroxysmal slowing, but without definitive spike and slow wave activity.
Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits for a young adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this EEG.  There are multiple, youthful findings noted in this EEG, but no pathological features were noted.
The previous EEG demonstrated some of these same youthful findings, but raised some concern as to possible underlying spike and wave activity.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the laboratory using the standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to T1 and T2 electrodes and 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through stage 1 sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 9-10 Hz seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  A stage 1 sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and posts.  Hyperventilation results in symmetrical slowing of the background activity.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.

HISTORY:  A 62-year-old woman with past medical history of anxiety that has been having constant jerking episodes when falling asleep of her extremities, abdomen and face that lately have worsened in frequency and have become intolerable and do not permit her to go to sleep.  She is here for classification of these episodes, rule out seizures/myoclonus versus nonepileptic spells.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Overall, the background appears to be normal.  However, as the patient becomes drowsy, intermittent muscle artifact jerks can be seen throughout the recording, at times the EMG artifact could be noted more over the left temporalis muscle than the right.  There appears to be no preceding cortical discharge prior to this muscle artifact.  The video does not reveal clear facial jerks although the technician reports that she noticed some facial jerking irregularly. At one point, the patient does have some abdominal flexion which occurs congruously or at the same time as the muscle artifact occurred. Again, none of these artifacts have a preceding cortical discharge that could be clearly seen.

INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well-formed and modulated 9 Hz moderate amplitude alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and symmetrical vertex waves are observed.  Hyperventilation was performed and the results have no significant change in the background.

First ever seizure 04/27 with loss of consciousness, twisting and post ictal confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Klonopin, previously treated with tramadol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
TECHNICAL:  The patient appears to be somewhat tense.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  During much of the EEG, there is a little bit more relaxed wakefulness with slowing of the alpha rhythm to 8.5 Hz.  Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in beta.  Other features of drowsiness include rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness with vertex waves noted in stage I sleep.
During hyperventilation and in relaxed wakefulness, there are 2 simple sharp waves.  During hyperventilation the simple sharp waves are more clearly defined after going slow wave.
Photic stimulation was remarkable for prominent beta and prominent, supraharmonic driving.
Additionally, hyperventilation was remarkable for a fair amount of muscle artifact.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within limits of normal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG demonstrated multiple, normal variants, some of which have the morphology of benign epileptiform discharges.  There is a single left mid to posterior temporal sharp wave.  In that there is only one discharge, this must be considered artifactual.  The generous beta described above may be due to this patient's medications.
If an underlying seizure disorder is an important consideration, a followup study with more prolonged sleep is suggested.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude of 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates.  Bursts of diffuse high amplitude centrally predominant theta are captured.  Also symmetrical vertex sleep spindles and K complexes are observed.  Hyperventilation was performed with good effort and produces mild diffuse background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetric driving at multiple flash frequencies. Excess diffuse beta is captured.
FINDINGS:
Stage 2 sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
Excess beta.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 22-minute EEG.  Excess beta could be secondary to medication affect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
