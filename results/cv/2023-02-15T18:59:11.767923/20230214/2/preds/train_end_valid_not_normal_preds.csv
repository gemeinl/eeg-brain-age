MEDICATIONS: Protonix, amoxicillin, Clarithromycin, diazepam, depakote, Zoloft, Lovenox, Tylenol, Percocet, Ceftriaxone

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation is not performed, but photic simulation was completed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of excess beta and theta. Brief drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving.

HR: 84 bpm

IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild excess beta and theta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. The excess beta and theta may be associated with medications used to treat this patient's other medical conditions. If epilepsy is an important consideration a follow-up study may be considered.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient is quite drowsy, but coherent.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an intermittent, somewhat slow pattern. Bursts of rhythmic frontally predominantly delta are observed. In addition, there are occasional bursts of slower more arrhythmic delta activity in the occipital regions. As the patient transitions into stage I sleep, vertex waves are observed. Photic stimulation is performed while she is relatively drowsy, but she does alert and there is brief driving response.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background much slower than expected for age.
2. FIRDA.
3. Occasional occipitally predominant delta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. In this individual who appears to be improving clinically, a followup study looking at her improvement over time may be useful.

History of cervical myelopathy. Intubated and paralyzed prior to the EEG.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Ativan, Etomidate, Fentanyl, Versed, ROCURONIUM
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is starting to emerge from paralysis and demonstrates stiffening and movements.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is a bit quieter. Activity demonstrates a slow pattern with some rhythmic mixed theta and delta on the left with a lower voltage, slower, a bit more suppressed pattern on the right, particularly in the temporal regions.
Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting with an increase in muscle as well as alpha and theta frequency activity. During the EEG, the patient starts to wake up, move around, and cough. After this, there is a more alert pattern with more theta frequency and alpha frequency activity from the left, but the right remains quite slow. By the end of the record in this very sharply contoured record, there was a suggestion of underlying sharp activity versus part of the fast activity at F3. In addition, more sharply contoured slowing is seen at T4-T6.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Nearly continuous focal slowing on the right hemisphere.
2. Occasional T4-T6 sharps and question F3 sharps as well.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe, bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function as would be expected following the use of sedative, hypnotic medications. The focal slowing and rare sharp waves on the right are compatible with past right temporal hemorrhage. Additional evaluation of this patient's cerebral function may be needed. Ongoing EEG monitoring was undertaken to make sure no additional seizures occurred.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. This was a 4-hour EEG study.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage pattern with intermittent theta and scant amounts of delta. Muscle artifact is observed. No myoclonus is noted. Occasional very subtle frontal sharp wave contoured theta waves are observed. As the muscle artifact drops out in the background, a discontinuous pattern is observed.

IMPRESSION: This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with a pattern of relatively invariant, arrhythmic theta delta.
2. Intermittent discontinuity.
3. Absence of reactivity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing demonstrates some positive but some negative findings for a patient status post significant anoxic injury. To put this in appropriate clinical context, the day of the anoxic injury should be documented. No epileptiform features were observed and no clinical seizures were noted. Of note, the background demonstrates less muscle and more discontinuity in the later portions of this 4-hour, critical care bedside recording.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic simulation was completed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat disorganized. There are some portions of maximal wakefulness where the overall pattern is reasonably well organized with a 9.5 hertz alpha rhythm. Other sections include bursts of frontally predominant rhythmic delta activity. In the transition to drowsiness, there is prominent arrhythmic delta activity and the overall background is more disorganized than one would except in a young adult. There is some shifting slowing and a single left temporal sharp wave is observed in this sharply contoured background. Stage II sleep includes vertex waves. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting in and out of stage II sleep and there is no significant driving response.

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background disorganization particularly in drowsiness.
2. FIRDA.
3. Posteriorly predominant arrhythmic delta activity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Only a single sharp wave was observed in this record. In this individual who is hospitalized on the 8th for complications of eclampsia, this is an improving pattern, but ongoing vigilance may be necessary.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient had a seizure just prior to the EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This EEG demonstrates some low voltage, subtlety discontinuous background. Some attenuation of about 3 seconds are interspersed with periods of low voltage, mixed theta delta. As the recording continues, the EEG is more continuous. There is some shifting asymmetries with more attenuation on the left compared to the right.

Seizure: The patient is in the ICU at the bedside. She starts to have rhythmic mixed theta delta out of the left hemisphere, particularly the temporal region at 10:36:43. This gradually builds up, but at 10:36:55 she starts to have a burst of fast activity out of the right hemisphere. The bursts of fast activity builds up exquisitely, while the left hemisphere as a different frequency of activity with rhythmic delta. This is followed by more of a generalized pattern characteristic of more of a tonic clonic pattern, although behaviorally the patient is only observed to be having facial and head twitching. The activity starts to slow at 10:37:41. As it stops, it shuts off at 10:38 on the right, but continues on the left before terminating abruptly at 10:38:20. Postictally there is prominent background suppression as was noted in the early portions of the record.

HR: 162 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A markedly abnormal background starting out with burst suppression pattern and actually ending with a burst suppression pattern.
2. A very complex seizure, which likely began on the left, generated to the right, with different frequencies of activity from the different hemispheres and a differential termination of the procedure.
3. Following the seizure there are handful of sharp waves on the left.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe underlying encephalopathy, as well as very unusual mechanism for epilepsy. This seizure pattern is more typical of a chronic epilepsy than acute reactive seizure.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is a fair amount of muscle artifact but the patient is relatively cooperative.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a somewhat slow and disorganized pattern with a 6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and occasional posteriorly predominant delta. On one occasion there seems to be a right frontocentral sharp wave, but unfortunately muscle artifact makes it difficult to determine if similar waveforms might have been seen on the left.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is abnormal. The background is primarily rhythmic theta with smaller amounts of delta. The definable posterior dominant rhythm is 5 Hz in a background with theta and delta. There are bursts of frontally predominantly spike and wave complexes noted in relaxed wakefulness. These are slightly asynchronous. Most are 3-5 Hz and in relaxed
wakefulness the bursts of generalized spike and wave activity are 1-3 seconds in duration. There are also some independent, isolated right or left temporal sharp waves noted in the background.
Hyperventilation is performed and produces an increase in the activity. In addition, during hyperventilation the patient complains of rapid or prominent heart rate.
Her baseline heart rate exceeds 100 beats per minute and in fact averages 110, actually dropping briefly to 96 during hyperventilation and then returning to tachycardia. Brief drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic slowing with spontaneous arousals. Lambda is observed in wakefulness.
Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response with supraharmonic driving at 11 Hz. In addition, there is a suggestion of a photo paroxysmal response as well. This is more clearly defined with frontally predominant polyspike activity with 19 Hz photic stimulation.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Frontally predominant spike and wave activity.
2. Background slowing and disorganization.
3. A suggestion of focal epileptiform activity.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old right handed woman with status epilepticus on April 2, 2010.
Hx of alcoholic dementia and CHI.

MEDICATIONS: Trileptal.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is no hyperventilation nor photic simulation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG in wakefulness is disorganized. There is a posterior dominant rhythm of 9Hz in the background with excess theta. There is an asymmetry in the alpha rhythm and at times it is more prominent on the left with more beta  activity on the right. Shifting slowing is observed but the slowing is more prominent on the right compared to the left and there is a right frontal sharp and slow wave complex noted. As the patient becomes drowsy, the right frontal epileptiform activity is more well defined with a spike and slow wave morphology, then spread to the frontotemporal region and phase reversal at F8 or FP2. In addition, in the later portions of the record where epileptiform activity is more prominent, the focal slowing in the right hemisphere is also more prominent with more disruption of faster frequency activity.

HR: 70 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right frontal sharp waves.
2. Generalized background slowing.
3. Focal slowing in the right hemisphere.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy. These findings may be correlated with the MRI. No seizures were recorded.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is a great deal of EKG artifact throughout this EEG, but despite the EKG artifact, there is a right anterior temporal sharp wave with focal slowing in the right frontal central region. Occasional bifrontal shifting slowing is noted as the patient transitions to stage 1 sleep. Other features of sleep include an increase in beta activity followed by vertex waves.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is drowsy or in stage II sleep throughout much of the record. The background is remarkable for abundant 13 and 15 Hz beta frequency activity as well as frontal artifact. The patient awakens for photic stimulation and for hyperventilation and at that point an 11 Hz alpha rhythm is identified but rapidly drifts back into a sleep state.

INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10á
20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient1s quite obtunded but has
some cranial nerve findings.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begin s, the background EEG is markedly
suppressed. There is a lower voltage subtle, periodic delta with a-sharp wave mixed in. This
sharp wave is picked up at T2, T4-C4, perhaps maximum at T4-C4. Stimulation of the patient
on 1 occasion produces a clear change in the background with rhythmic periodic activity. In
addition, there is some sustained periodic discharge in the right hemisphere, which seems to
have an admixed right central temporal sharp wave. Looking at the video, it appears that the
patient has movement of the right thoracic region In association with this. This discharge Is brief
and subsides on its own. A second, remarkable discharge Is identified with sharp activity
present bilaterally but clearly maximum in the right hemisphere. On this occasion, the video
does not identify a clinical correlate and this second event is without a doubt an electrographic
seizure. In total, there are 3 well-defined electrographic seizures noted in !he record. One of
!hem seems to be stimulus sensitive and other 2 did not have clear clinical correlates.
HR: 120-150 bpm
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Three electrographic seizures.
2. interictal pattern of marked background suppression.
3. Epileptiform activity, which Is primarily on the right but is complex in nature.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function. It
also demonstrates a very irritative focus on the right. Ongoing EEG monitoring was requested
to determine the patient's response to therapy.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is initially quite somnolent but by the end of the record has transitioned from a face mask to nasal cannula oxygen and is uncomfortable, intermittently shifting her arms and is quite tachypneic. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing beings, the background EEG is quite slow with a mixture of delta and theta. There is a bit more theta in the temporal regions. There is a suspicious underlying sharp wave in the occipital region maximal at O1. Stimulation of the patient does not seem to produce a clinical alerting response, but the EEG is remarkable for increasing faster frequency activity. At the end of the record, the patient is more interactive and is a bit more tachycardic.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Significant background slowing.
2. Shifting slowing, at times a little slower on the left compared to the right.
3. Question of an underlying O1 small, discrete spike.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 7 Hz posterior dominant
rhythm. There is a small degree of excess theta and background disorganization.
Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and produces an asymmetric
response with more prominent rhythmic theta delta from the right frontotemporal region
compared to the left. Following this as the patient becomes drowsy this asymmetry
persists. Photic stimulation is performed shortly after the hyperventilation and the
asymmetry remains. Photic stimulation does not otherwise activate the record.
Additional features of drowsiness include an inc..ease in background slowing which is
relatively symmetric.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the left frontotemporal region, which is accentuated by
hyperventilation.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient is intubated and febrile as described above. Current body temperature 103.8.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG does demonstrate a preserved cerebral pattern. There is low to medium voltage, mixed frequency primary theta frequency activity of 5.4 hertz, but there is also some 3.5 hertz delta activity and smaller amounts of beta. In this video study, the patient is postured with his head looking to the right. The big EEG machine and video camera are on the left. The camera demonstrates intermittent jerking of the chest and this correlates with some muscle artifact seen diffusely through the EEG. The brief jerks of muscle artifact are not clearly associated with epileptiform activity. There is a suggestion of a vertex sharp wave seen independently of the jerks and on 1 or 2 occasions, as the recording continues, there does appear to be a slow wave that follows some of the jerks. There is a small degree of discontinuity.

HR: 144 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A primarily theta/theta delta pattern following cardiac arrest.
2. High amplitude myoclonic jerks, but some of these seem to have an after going slow wave.
3. Vertex sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The presence of an after going slow wave would suggest that the myoclonus is epileptiform in nature. Additional intervention may be appropriate.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 7.6 Hz alpha rhythm. The overall background is quite low voltage. In addition, there are intermittent bursts or rhythmic delta activity from the right hemisphere with a generous field of spread but maximum in the mid to anterior temporal region. The higher amplitude rhythmic delta is most prominent right central and temporal region and is also associated with a breach rhythm. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background as well as accentuating the rhythmic activity from the right hemisphere and an underlying sharp wave maximum F81T2. During and tolerating hyperventilation, the focal slowing becomes continuous. As the patient becomes drowsy, the delta transitions to a bit more or a posterior temporal area and some of the sharp waves are mid to posterior temporal. In the transition to sleep, there are some discreet spikes than the left temporal region. They carry the characteristic morphology of a benign variant but are seen too frequently to be considered a benign variant. Photic stimulation produces scant driving.
HR: 104 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Prominent focal slowing with rhythmic delta from the right hemisphere.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode
placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. The patient Is
agitated during the EEG and receives Ativan.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the background is a bit slow when the patient
becomes agitated, he wakes up and there is a prominent 12. hertz alpha rhythm noted bilaterally.
Approximately 10 seconds Into the arousal state with the bilateral alpha as the patient becomes agitated,
more rhythmic4-5 hertz activity emerges from the left central and parietal regions. The behavior of of the
patient is difficult to observe because the caregiver is trying to restrain the patient. The patient is
described as agitated and poor1y responsive by the caregiver during the seizure. He seems to have
looked to his right during the seizure although the caregiver approaches from the left obscuring the view.
A second seizure occurs and again Is characterized by first a somewhat slow background and then in this
case at 16:56:05, a burst of bilateral fast activity following the appearance of the theta on the left at
16:56:11 and then as this occurs, there is more fast activity bilaterally, more clear evidence of a breach
with higher amplitude fast activity more so on the left than the right and then more definitive frequency
evolution is noted at 16:57:11 as the patient postures through to the right with head turning to the right
and what seems like a decorticate or dystonic posturing of the right hand more so than the left. He also
has some irregular respirations and then some clonic activity. There is a problem with the EEG and the
EEG stops recording although the video continues through the end of the seizure. The technologist
attempts to fix the EEG problems while the patient seems to have had a 3rd seizure during the EEG. A
4th event is noted at 17:04:44 again with the patient turning to the left and this seems to merge onto a 5th

Focal epileptiform activity is also observed including CZ, C3, and left anterior temporal. What appears to be generalized paroxysmal fast activity of approximately alpha frequency is noted. The patient drifts off to sleep with vertex waves and in sleep there seems to be ongoing slow spike and wave activity. In the transition to sleep, felt parietal sharp waves are noted. Photic stimulation does no activate the record.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient has a tracheostomy but is responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a marked intrahemispheric asymmetry. The activity from the right hemisphere is markedly low-voltage and suppressed. The left hemisphere demonstrates a pattern sometimes rich in alpha frequency activity, and at times there is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm. Other sections of the record include more delta underlying the alpha frequency activity on the left. In the sections of the record when the patient is resting comfortably, there is a suggestion of an 8.3 Hz alpha rhythm on the right; however, this may represent volume conduction from the left. There are sections of the record with eye movement and other sections when the patient seems to be becoming drowsy with a prominent decrease in alpha frequency activity on the left.

This patient had a past history of nystagmus which was not associated with epileptiform activity. She continues to have frequent eye movement artifact. This is not associated with epileptiform activity. The slowing on the left is less prominent than one might expect, given the degree of mass effect and herniation into the left.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This Is an awake through stage 2 sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD The patient appears to be drowsy throughout much of the record. There are some sections in apparent wakefulness where there is a pattern with 7.3 Hz activity in the background and some faster 15Hz activity. There is at times a 10Hz alpha rhythm. As the patient transitions into stage 2 steep with vertex waves, K-complexes and spindles., frontally predominant spike and wave and polyspike and wave activity is Identified at 3 to 5 Hz.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess background 7.5 Hz activity and wakefulness.
2. Frontally predominant spike and wave and polyspike and wave activity, identified quite prominently In sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The excess 7.5 Hz activity was not previously described in other records and may be part of this patient's underlying neurologic process or due to underlying sleep deprivation. It does correlate with a faster frequency harmonic also noted in the background. The generalized, polyspike and spike and wave activity has been previously described. No absence seizures were recorded; however, the patient does seem to be quite drowsy.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is poorly responsive but this study does include wakefulness and sleep.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and lacks all of the developmental milestones for an adult of this age. The overall background is one of theta with lower voltage slow frequency activity. Superimposed upon this there are occasional high amplitude sharp waves picked up with a generous field of spread which are primarily in the left central regions but are picked up bilaterally. When the patient drifts off to sleep, there is an increase in beta. Posteriorly predominant slow activity is noted.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is not intubated, he sits with his head turned to the left and his right arm postured.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a overall slow pattern with a mixture of beta, theta and delta. There is a high amplitude periodic complex noted in the right hemisphere with some variability in terms of amplitude maximum. Sometimes it is maximum C4, other times right frontal. It may be high or low in amplitude. It does not demonstrate frequency evolution but it does have a very large field of spread. With the use of an average reference it is typically right frontal or central parietal. Occasionally after the sharp waves there is a brief attenuation in the background lasting approximately a second. The epileptiform activity can be reviewed at slow paper speed. In using slow paper speed there is no definitive evolution of the activity. Stimulation of the patient produces a withdrawal response but does not particularly activate the EEG.

In relaxed wakefulness there are brief bursts of frontally predominant 3 to 5 Hz spike in wave activity with bursts typically 1.8 seconds in duration. Most are under 2 seconds and none exceed 3 seconds in duration. Hyperventilation seems to accentuate these bursts. An attempt to test for responsiveness during stimulation is attempted but the bursts are so brief that it is not possible to complete the test before the burst is over. There are no deficits in recall identified during the bursts. On rare occasions as the patient becomes drowsy, some of the bursts are a bit more maximum in the right frontal region.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess theta.
2. Some shifting slowing.
3. Left frontal and T1 sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The sharply contoured background may make sharp
waves more different from the background. The background slowing in this organization may be part of this patient's brain pattern or due to the medications.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, while there is some eye artifact picked up in the T1 and T2 electrodes, there is also some sharply contoured slowing observed. There appear to be some sharp waves noted in the record which do not correlate with the patient's eye movement artifact. These are maximum at T1. This burst of activity is seen most prominently just at the end of hyperventilation with sharply contoured slowing. Later on in the record, just at the end of the hyperventilation with the patient drifting off to sleep, a little bit more clearly defined left temporal sharply contoured slowing is again seen with some isolated bursts. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background theta. During photic stimulation there is a bilateral driving, but again a handful of these sharply contoured bursts are noted.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left rhythmic temporal focal slowing.
2. Sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization related mechanism for epilepsy. The focal slowing is again supportive of this. Additional evaluation may be important to determine if the frequent, daily, subtle space out spells are part of the same phenomenon.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is awake, but confused.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and includes a continuous, high amplitude periodic complex in the right posterior quadrant at
Ts/01. In some locations it seems to be maximum at 01 and other at T5. This high amplitude discharge has some volume conduction to the contralateral occipital region. The amplitude of the activity exceeds 250 microvolts. It has the characteristic of PEDS PLUS. In addition, in some points it is essentially a left hemispheric spike and slow wave complex. No clinical seizures are noted during the record, but at one point the activity starts to transition to more of a rhythmic theta-delta. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. At the close of the record, despite the high amplitude periodic complex in the right occipital region, the patient is conversant.
HR: 107bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Essentially continuous periodic complex from the left occipital parietal region.
2. Potentially a subclinical seizure when the continuous sharp waves transition to more of a rhythmic theta-delta pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a highly irritative process. No clinical seizures were recorded. The EEG technologist did contact the clinical team on call to review this study.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is not cooperative. In addition, patient has periods of agitation with waxing and waning mental status.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall background is slow and disorganized, with a mix of delta and theta, with transition to more theta, especially when the patient is moving around. With agitation, the records have increased disorganization and increase in delta especially when patient is agitated, is compatible with delirium. Patient is not cooperative and has irregular heartbeat with some PVC's. There is a small amount of beta in the record. Heart rate of this patient is 100.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
I. Excess theta.
2. Increase in theta frequency when patient is agitated compatible with delirium.
3. Diffuse disorganization of the record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background is slow in disorganization in addition to the increased theta with patient's agitation may be consistent with alterations of delirium. There is no spike and wave activity and there are no triphasic waves observed in this record.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an almost exclusively sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a stage I and stage II sleep with frequent transitions between stage I and stage II. There are vertex wave, K-complexes, spindles and POSTS.  Some of the vertex waves are somewhat asymmetric. While most are maximum at CZ, they have a more generous field of spread and the diphasic wave is significantly higher amplitude and more prolonged on the left compared to the right. The composition of the wave forms, however, is quite similar with a 0.97 hertz after going slow wave. Brief wakefulness includes a 9.5 hertz alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is in stage II sleep and does not activate the record, significant snore artifact is noted.
HR:  N/A
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Asynchronous vertex waves with more prominent field of spread on the left in sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's sleep pattern with frequent transitions between stage I and stage II sleep and prominent snoring may be part of an underlying sleep disturbance and can contribute to the nocturnal seizures. The asynchronous sleep wave forms may be correlated with imaging. No definitive epileptiform findings were noted, however.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. The patient is quite drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial sections of the EEG demonstrate prominent, rhythmic slowing from the right temporal region, particularly the posterior temporal region. Triangular shaped, periodic complexes, are noted at T6, O2, primarily at T6. As the recording continues, additional sharp waves are noted with a phase of reversal that is more mid to anterior temporal T2-T4. Focal slowing accompanies these sharp waves and there are bursts of focal slowing mid to posterior temporal region and sometimes involving C4. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is transitioning into stage 2 sleep and does not activate the record.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right temporal focal slowing.
2. Initially posteriorly predominant periodic right temporal sharp waves.
3. Right anterior temporal sharp waves as the recording continues.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The waking background is somewhat disorganized with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with prominent, sharply contoured frontal theta as the patient drifts off to sleep, there are bursts of frontal slowing and vertex waves but underneath this there seems to be a shifting right or left frontocentral sharp wave. The patient is noted to be very sleepy and requires stimulation to stay away through hyperventilation but near the beginning of hyperventilation, occasional right frontocentral sharp waves are observed. At this time, again, this asymmetric frontal mixed theta delta is noted again more prominent on the right. Photic stimulation is remarkable for an individual who is drifting into deeper stages of sleep and there is no definitive driving response.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The activity from the left hemisphere is well organized with a 9.5 Hz, microvolt posterior dominant rhythm. In the right hemisphere. there is a prominent breech rhythm, craniotomy defect, prominent disruption of faster
frequency activity from the right temporal region with some head rocking artifacts. The features compared in the para sagittal regions include accentuation of the amplitude on the right compared to the left and a bit of underlying slowing, particularly in the posterior quadrant but they are not as dramatic as the continuous focal slowing In the left temporal region. Hyperventilation seems to accentuate the focal slowing on the right.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall background is somewhat slow and disorganized. High amplitude temporal sharp and slow wave complexes are noted which can be seen independently from the right or left temporal region. Features of drowsiness include vertex waves. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record. Hyperventilation accentuates left temporal sharp waves.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The patient is restless and moving about.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a remarkable and fluctuating asymmetry.  Some sections of the record demonstrate attenuation of faster frequency activity on the right with the exception of bursts of beta more prominent on the right.  Other sections of the record demonstrate much more significant underlying arrhythmic delta activity underneath the alpha-frequency activity in the left hemisphere.  A 9 Hz alpha rhythm can be identified from either hemisphere, sometimes symmetrically, sometimes asymmetrically.  There is also some sharply contoured slowing and a handful of T1, T3 sharp waves on the left.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta, particularly on the right.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This is an interesting and abnormal EEG due to:
Fluctuating asymmetries with at times more underlying arrhythmic delta on the left or right.
Asymmetries on the right, some of which would suggest a cortical process on the right such as disruption of faster frequency activity with disruption of the alpha frequency, but an increase in beta would contradict this.

system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is extremely sleepy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In drowsiness there is a rhythmic background with
a posterior dominant rhythm of 6-7, but alerting the patient attenuates the alpha rhythm
and a normal awake pattern is seen. In the transition to in and out of sleep, frequent,
high amplitude frontally predominant spike an d wave and polyspike and wave
complexes are noted. Dyschromia is noted. Photic stimulation serves to awaken the
patient. It also produces bursts of high amplitude frontally predominantly 3-5 Hz spike
and wave activity. Nearly all of these bursts are high amplitude frontal and symmetric,
but on rare occasions there is a pair of discharges in the right frontal region.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is low-voltage.  There is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is intermittent low-voltage theta and delta in what is otherwise a quite low-voltage record.  There are sections of the record where the background is well organized with lambda.  Prominent eye artifact is observed. Photic stimulation functions as an alerting response with symmetric driving.
HR:    60 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The intermittent excess theta is a nonspecific finding and can be seen in the context of a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function such as underlying ischemic cerebrovascular disease or dementia.  No epileptiform features
have been seen in any of her EEGs.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study is suggested.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a mixture of beta and theta.  There is high amplitude, posteriorly predominant paroxysmal activity, some of which has a suspicious spike and wave activity.  There is also some activity which seems to have a sharp wave in the frontal region and there is some triangularly shaped frontal sharp waves noted as well. Hyperventilation seems to accentuate epileptiform activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excess beta.
Excess theta.
Posteriorly predominantly paroxysmal activity.
Some frontal sharp waves.
An abnormal background with replacement of normal background with beta and theta.
Absence of an alpha rhythm.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel  EKG.  The patient has multiple seizures characterized by head turning to the right, posturing to the right, and poor responsiveness.  He also sleeps with his hand clenched on the LTM equipment.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The normal wave forms for an adult are not identified.  The LTM is more of a pattern of theta with generous beta. In sleep, although there are some electrode artifacts, there does appear to be some left frontal sharp waves.
There are intermittent bursts of rhythmic theta frequency activity in the frontal regions, left more than right. There are many push button events with these typical events in an individual who is quite confused.  He looks to the right and postures and turns to the right.
There is little in the way of a clear EEG correlate noted early in the seizures, particularly in this individual who pushes the buttons himself.  There is a subtle change a bit in that there is a bit more theta evolving in the frontal temporal regions, left greater than right.
In contrast to the previous LTM recordings, there is less of the posteriorly predominant generalized activity.
HR:    60 bpm
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are very similar to a previous study performed for this individual on September 27, 2011.  No seizures were recorded in either EEG.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is tremulous throughout the EEG with rhythmic
3╖4 hertz activity. In the brief sections were the patient's jitteriness resolves, the overall
background is one of beta and 2╖3 hertz delta. Review of the video demonstrates not so much
movement, but he does have titubation of the head and that likely accentuates the amount of
EEG artifact. In addition, during the a section of the record where the patient Is not moving, he
has a section with higher amplitude left central sharp waves. There is also another section with
a great deal of artifact and asymmetry with more rhythmic almost vertex like waves on the right
rather than the left. This was an extremely technically challenging study.
HR: 78 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with a beta pattern with smaller amounts of delta.
2. In some sections of the record with the potential for activity in the central
regions which differ from the EKG artifact. This was seen independently from the right and
left. but with a prominent burst on the left
CLINICAL This EEG Is congruent with encephalopathy bu1 with sharp waves
and paroxysmal behavioral changes consider video EEG.

MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record in an individual who is a bit drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 9 Hz, symmetric, reactive alpha rhythm.  Prominent wicket is noted.  In addition, the wicket is a little bit more remarkable on the left.
In maximal wakefulness the background EEG is symmetric, but in relaxed wakefulness there is an asymmetry with a bit higher amplitude theta on the left and a bit more prominent wicket on the left.
Brief vertex waves are noted in stage 1 sleep.  The patient is quite drowsy, but deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.  The patient is asleep during photic stimulation.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
An asymmetry in the amplitude and the prominence as stated in the left hemisphere in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were no epileptiform features.  These findings have an intermediate correlation with a structural functional abnormality on the left.  Correlation with imaging is suggested.

INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video long-term monitoring EEG was performed at bedside for 13 hours using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes. Continuous spike detection software and seizure detection software were used to review the EEG, as well as patient reported events. The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep. No activating procedures were performed.



TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: None.



DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record opens to a diffusely slow posterior dominant rhythm which at best reaches 6 to 7 Hz, which appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening. There is some frontocentral beta seen. There are some stage changes during the recording with some typical features of sleep architecture. No activating procedures were performed.



ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:

1. Focal slow waves seen intermittently at T3 and T4, at times with a sharp contour but not clearly epileptic.

2. Generalized slow waves at 5 to 7 Hz, seen continuously throughout the recording.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow.  There is excess theta identified.  There is a glimpse of an alpha reaching from 7-10 Hz.  In relaxed wakefulness, there are rare, high amplitude left anterior temporal sharp and slow wave complexes. Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta. After this, as the patient becomes drowsy there are subtle F7/T1 sharp waves noted. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.  Following photic stimulation a single, well defined right frontal temporal spike and slow wave complex is also noted and then later more discreet discharges, more compatible with a normal variant. In the final seconds of the EEG, another medium amplitude left anterior temporal discharge is identified, which is a spike. By the end of the recording, the background disorganization is somewhat improved.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There is a single well defined sharp wave on the right which must be considered artifact, although may represent variable distribution of the left anterior temporal sharp wave.  The background slowing does improve a bit as the recording continuous, which may be part of a postictal phenomenon.  Correlation with imaging given the presence of focal sharp waves or spikes in an adult is suggested.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excess drowsiness.
A maximal wakefulness background slowing.
Bursts of paroxysmal delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  The FIRDA and background slowing are nonspecific findings which could be due to a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function or a postictal state.  They may also be seen in a metabolic disturbance.  The irregular heart rate may be evaluated by other means.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.   Hyperventilation was not performed due to the sinus problems, but photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat disorganized, but there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is slight shifting asymmetries noted in the alpha rhythm and it is a little faster on the left than the right.  There is also a lit bit of slowing noted at some points when the alpha rhythm is identified and that slowing is on the right.  Arrhythmic delta is noted in the left hemisphere, particularly central temporal region.  There is a suggestion of a breech rhythm with both a beta accentuation noted at some points and some underlying sharp waves.  Unfortunately, artifacts are also noted in the same region.
Brief drowsiness includes vertex waves with transitions in and out of sleep.  Snore artifact is observed.  Photic stimulation elicits a driving response better identified on the right than the left.  The patient continues to transition in and out stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles, again, some of which are asymmetric.

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient has a pneumonia.  A pulmonary stimulator is utilized which produces artifact in the right scalp electrodes which resemble a seizures, but this activity is confirmed to be artifactual during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing opens the patient is quite sleepy.  There are left anterior temporal spikes.  The overall background in rich in theta, but there is an asymmetry in that the left hemisphere is significantly slower than the right.
Through the course of the record the patient is increasingly awake.  Rhythmic, alpha, and theta frequency activity is noted from the right.  The left hemisphere demonstrates focal slowing and sharp waves with left temporal sharp waves.  These are seen in wakefulness through stage II sleep.  No electrographic seizures are noted.
As the patient is increasingly awake and is extubated, the vest to mobilize the patient's chest secretions is used more substantially.  This produces artifact from the right temporal region, but the patient can be tested at the bedside.  The artifact will stop when the device is turned off and the patient is awake.
HR:   80 to 100 bpm

Prominent epileptiform activity from the left hemisphere, improving over the 24 hour recording.
Focal slowing with disruption of faster frequency activity on the left.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely low attenuated background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or normal frontocentral beta.  Patient had no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Throughout the recording, there are frequent frontally predominant and right more than left sharp waves which appeared to start and decrease in frequency for about 2-10 seconds with some minimal spread to the left hemisphere.  During these discharges, the patient appears to move and it is difficult to be clear of the precise locations of the discharges.

MEDICATIONS:  Percocet, Labetalol, Heparin, Motrin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow.  The alpha reaches 7.5 Hz. Features of drowsiness includes rhythmic background slowing with vertex waves, POSTS, as well as a handful of spindles in stage II sleep.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in background theta. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. Abnormalities in this EEG include slowing of the alpha rhythm.  In addition, there are a handful of sharp waves, typically at T1, but with some at T3 noted in relaxed wakefulness and accentuated in hyperventilation.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The slow alpha rhythm is a nonspecific finding, it can be seen in a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function, as well as in a disorder of a process
involving the thalamic and occipital pathways.  The left temporal sharp waves raise a concern for a focal mechanism for seizures.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The technologist notes a craniotomy defect on the right.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a periodic complex in the left hemisphere.  It starts in the left frontotemporal region but demonstrates significant spread throughout the left hemisphere and using different montages seems to end in the occipital region, phase reversing at O1 and O2.  The discharge has complex morphology and a periodicity of about 1 per second.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is intubated and poorly responsive, but unfortunately has a great deal of muscle artifact.  This EEG is markedly abnormal.  It demonstrates a slow more featureless pattern on the left.  There is complex epileptiform activity with discharge, which appears in the occipital regions involving 01, 02, but with significant spread in the right posterior quadrants.  Epileptiform activity is prominent in the occipital regions.  It is not all entirely identical, sometimes demonstrates a phase reversal and a referential montage.  It is often picked up with a maximum at P3 and then a lower voltage potential that follows in the occipital parietal region on the left and then spreads to the right posterior region.  Other sharp waves demonstrate a more significant involvement in the right frontal regions.  The activity on the left is quite attenuated.   Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity on the right.  Unfortunately stimulation of the patient also produces a great deal of muscle and movement artifact.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7 Hz seen mainly over the right hemisphere.  There is some frontal central beta seen best over the right hemisphere also.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient when stimulated appears to have some muscle response to stimulation.  Some patterns of sleep architecture, stage I, are seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slowing seen over the left hemisphere, maximally in the mid temporal and anterior temporal regions at a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 mV.  In addition, in this region there is almost complete loss of the faster frequency, especially over the temporal and some over the left central region and the frequencies are all low voltage and attenuated.

Focal sharp waves seen with a white field, but maximal at T4 with a frequency of 1-3 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV almost continuously throughout the recording with no clear evolution and some intermittent periods of pause for 2 seconds.  These are consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLED'S).

In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  However, the spindle like discharges suggest it may be, at least in part, due to medication effect.  No seizures were seen during this routine recording.

The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection software as well as seizure detection software and nurses' alarm noted events were used to review the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage I, stage II, and deeper stages of sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves at F7/T3 seen occasionally in wakefulness and sleep.
Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 at 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  Seizure #1, 07/18/2012 at 10:30 a.m., complex partial seizure.  In the video, the patient suddenly places down his cell phone.  Suddenly his arms raise and he lays back.  After this, the right arm suddenly becomes dystonic and stiff.  He starts having automatic movements with the left arm, playing around with the cell phone and the sheet, and his face remains in a staring fashion.  At times he moves his mouth.  He continues this behavior during the entirety of the seizure.
EEG:  The EEG seizure started at 10:33 a.m. and ended at 10:34 a.m. The EEG correlate to the seizure started at 7 seconds after the clinical onset.  There is rhythmic theta discharge seen maximally at the beginning at T1/F7, which evolves in frequency and increases in amplitude.  It remains mainly over the T1/F7 electrodes but it spread throughout the whole left hemisphere.  After the end of the seizure, there appears to be an asymmetry of the faster frequencies with a lack of them over the left hemisphere.  End of seizure #1.
Seizure #2, complex partial seizure, occurred on 07/19/2012, starting at 2:48:57, ending at 2:49:52.  Video behavior:  While in bed the patient starts blinking and moving his mouth.  Suddenly his right arm becomes dystonic and his right eye shuts down and appears to twitch slightly while he continues to move his mouth.  Seconds later, he starts having rhythmic automatisms of the left hand and playing with the sheet.  He continues this behavior until the end of the seizure.
EEG:  About 10 seconds after clinical onset, the EEG reveals well-formed rhythmic 7 Hz theta discharge, maximal over the T1/F7 electrode, which is slightly obscured by muscle artifact which appears to continue to evolve in frequency and increase in amplitude over the left hemisphere.  The seizure remains on the left hemisphere.  It does not cross to the right.  After the end of the seizure, there appear to be a lot of faster frequencies over that left hemisphere and not noticed over the right.  The seizure lasts for 55 seconds.  End of seizure #2.
Seizure #3, electrographic seizures.  During the record, he had about 4 distinct electrographic seizures which were comprised of rhythmic runs of F7/T3 theta discharge that appeared to increase slightly in amplitude and then suddenly stop.  These 4 events lasted as long as 4 minutes.  During them, in the video there is no clear clinical correlate.  End of seizure.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 23-minute awake and asleep EEG due to mild diffuse slowing, moderate bifrontal slowing, and occasional frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).  Diffuse slowing is a nonspecific indicator of diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal bifrontal slowing may be indicative of bifrontal structural abnormalities. FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity) is a nonspecific finding and could be seen in encephalopathy, increased intracranial pressure, and deep white
matter abnormalities.  No epileptiform discharges are captured.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

DIAGNOSIS:  Change in mental status, rule out seizure.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 42-year-old ambidextrous male with a history of catatonia, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and obstructive sleep apnea who presents with increased agitation.  The patient is nonverbal since 09/15/2012.
MEDICATIONS:  The patient's medications include Tegretol, baclofen, lorazepam, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed at the bedside using the standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to one channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This tracing captured the patient in a confused and agitated state.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is diffuse slowing of background activity consisting of 5 to 6 Hz theta activity intermixed intermittently with 1.5 to 2 Hz delta activity during wakefulness, which is distributed symmetrically.  There were occasional bursts of frontal intermittent delta activity, FIRDA, seen with a frequency of 1 to 1.2 Hz and an amplitude of 60 to 70 microvolts, lasting for 1 to 2 seconds.  There is also a small amount of low amplitude diffuse beta activity which is distributed symmetrically.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple frequencies and did not result in a driving response.  The patient was agitated during the study, which makes the study limited due to the presence of movement and muscle artifact at times.  Heart rate 100 to 110 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to diffuse slowing of background activity with theta and delta range during wakefulness.  There is also FIRDA bursts during wakefulness.  This study is limited due to the presence of movement and muscle artifacts.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings could be due to metabolic toxic, hypoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the fact of sedating medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  The generalized beta activity could be due to medication effect including benzodiazepines or barbiturates, or could be due to anxiety or hyperthyroidism.  The presence of FIRDA is also associated with increased intracranial pressure or midline brain mass.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record.  No seizures are captured.  This does not rule out a diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.  If clinically indicated, a repeat EEG or continuous bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was unable to participate in hyperventilation. Photic stimulation was completed.  This was an awake and drowsy record in a somewhat anxious patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Some sections of the record are reasonably well organized with a 6.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  This is excess beta and excess theta.  There is a small degree of disorganization noted in the background.  Photic stimulation does elicit driving with harmonic, supraharmonic and subharmonic driving.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a past medical history of seizures secondary to motor vehicle accident in 1994.  The patient reports approximately 3 seizures a month with the last seizure being on 09/28/2012.  The seizures are described as lip smacking, loss of train of thought, and aphasic.  Postictal period is characterized by migraine and confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Fioricet, meloxicam, Singulair, loratadine, and Lipitor.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 9-10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eye opening.  There is fast alpha variant.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies and lower amplitudes observed anteriorly.  Drowsiness is captured, but stage II sleep is not recorded.  Hyperventilation is performed and is characterized by symmetrical diffuse slowing as well as accentuation of left posterior quadrant sharp waves.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  There are intermittent moderate amplitude sharp waves with slow waves observed over the left posterior quadrant with phase reversal over T5 and O1 electrodes.  Occasionally there is a reflection over the right posterior quadrant leads.  No electrographic seizures are captured.
FINDINGS:  Intermittent sharp waves over the left posterior quadrant, primarily observed over T5, O1 electrodes.  No electrographic seizures.  No stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 24-minute EEG due to intermittent epileptiform discharges over the left posterior quadrant, most notable over T5 and O1 electrodes.  This finding indicates underlying structural dysfunction that carries an epileptogenic potential.  No electrographic seizures are captured.

Continuous focal slowing seen at C4/T4 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 microvolts.  At times this is sharply contoured.
Intermittent focal slowing at times seen at F7/T3, frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to continuous right central temporal focal slowing as well as some intermittent left anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction in the right central temporal region, which is consistent with the known mass.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.

MEDICATIONS:  Pepcid, morphine, Lopressor, paroxetine, methadone, heparin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake and drowsy and stage 1 sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 5 Hz which appears somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is some faster frequencies in frontocentral beta seen intermittently and some stage 1 sleep architecture appears to be seen.  Overall, there is a diffusely slow background in the delta range seen almost continuously throughout the recording.  No activating procedures were performed.

The patient remained mute after the seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Ativan, Keppra, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab  using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was initially somnolent, then inattentive.  This was an awake through stage II sleep record.  After the patient drifted off to sleep, it was somewhat difficult to awaken the patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The tracing begins with stage II sleep with central spindle activity.  Focal slowing is noted from the left temporal region with left temporal sharp waves.  The sharp waves are mid to anterior temporal with a generous field spread.  They are discrete, at 70 microvolts at the maximum.  In the T1 and T2 montage they are maximum at T1.
The patient is still quite drowsy during photic stimulation.  During photic stimulation, there are trains of left anterior temporal sharp waves as the patient transitions in and out of stage II sleep.
The technologist attempts to awaken the patient for hyperventilation without success.  The patient remains in stage II sleep again with prominent sharp waves from the left temporal region.
Heart rate 96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal sharp waves.
Left temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are relatively characteristic of temporal lobe epilepsy.  This patient's postictal state may account for the hypersomnolence as it might be the use of benzodiazepines.

Her last seizure was 2 months ago, described as feeling dizzy and strange, lasting for 1-2 minutes.  Past medical history is also significant for neurofibromatosis.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the laboratory using the standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement, in addition to T1 and T2 electrodes and 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through drowsiness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 11-12 Hz in frequency, 30-40 microvolts in amplitude seen in the occipital region which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifacts.  There was intermittent burst of focal slowing in the left anterior and mid temporal regions at F7/T3 consisting of 2.5 to 3 Hz delta frequency activity, 30-40 microvolts in amplitude, lasting for 1-2 seconds. Hyperventilation results in slowing of the background most prominent on the left side.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate was 70 to 80 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to intermittent bursts of focal slowing in the left temporal region during wakefulness and short periods of drowsiness.  There were no epileptiform abnormalities or seizures identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Left temporal slowing could be suggestive of an underlying structural abnormalities in the left hemisphere or left temporal dysfunction. There were no epileptiform abnormalities or seizures noted during this recording.  If seizures are of clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.

MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Keppra, and enalapril.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.  In relaxed wakefulness there is a small amount of shifting slowing with occasional, independent right or left temporal slowing.
Hyperventilation was performed early in the record producing an increase in theta, a little bit more so on the left than the right.  Some of this was rhythmic, but some was somewhat arrhythmic as well.
Sleep was characterized by a prominent increase in beta.  Spindles were noted.  Again, there was a small amount of shifting slowing noted in sleep.  Vertex waves and POSTS were also seen.  As the patient transitions in and out of sleep, there was some rhythmic, hypnagogic hypersynchrony.
Photic stimulation was performed at the end of the record when the patient was awake.  A normal background was noted at that time.  Despite the tech's attempt to maintain him in an awake state during photic stimulation, the patient started to drift off to sleep during photic.  A driving response was elicited.
Heart rate:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to: Occasional bursts of shifting slowing noted as the patient transitions in and out of drowsiness and in hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No sharp waves or spikes were seen.  There were no specific hallmarks of an underlying seizure disorder.  The shifting slowing noted in the transition to sleep is characteristic of that seen in older adults with cerebrovascular disease.  It is, however, a nonspecific finding.  In this individual with new onset seizures, perhaps a more prolonged sleep recording may be helpful in the search for epileptiform activity.

CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  There is right to left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms at higher amplitudes over the right hemisphere.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the left hemisphere consists of well-formed and modulated 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is also anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes observed over the left hemisphere.  There is no posterior dominant rhythm or anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient over the right hemisphere.  The background over the right hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity with under riding faster frequencies.  Diffuse excess beta is observed.  During sleep vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes are captured.  Sleep architecture is better formed over the left hemisphere.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation does not result in additional abnormalities.  Premature QRS complexes are captured on a single electrocardiogram lead.
FINDINGS:
Moderate continuous right hemispheric slowing.
Excess beta.
Stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal wake and asleep 24 minute EEG due to continuous moderate right hemispheric slowing.  This finding indicates focal right hemispheric dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, and in this patient is consistent with a history of a prior right MCA stroke.  Excess beta could be secondary to a medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

Abnormal discharges:  Intermittent focal slowing seen at T3 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 50 microvolts.
Episode at 11:55 p.m.:  The patient was noted on video to suddenly stiffen his body, stretch out his right arm, grab up to the rail of the bed, and shake and tremble rapidly, causing the entire bed to shake.  The nurse came to talk to the patient and he appeared to be unresponsive.  The patient had his head stretched backward and it was not clear if his eyes were open or closed based on the video.  The episode lasted until 11:59 p.m.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to intermittent left midtemporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG revealed evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left midtemporal region, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  The episode seen on video appears to clinically have features of a nonepileptic event; however, no clear commentary can be made since there was no EEG that could be reviewed during the time of the episode.  No further episodes were captured on this day #1 of monitoring.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  Hyperventilation was not.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  The overall EEG is relatively low voltage.  The patient transitions in and out of a drowsy state and as he does so, there are occasional bursts of shifting slowing followed by a pattern with rhythmic slowing.  Rare FIRDA is noted as the patient becomes drowsy.  Sleep was not sustained.
Photic stimulation elicited driving and supraharmonic driving.
Heart rate 42 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to a bit more shifting slowing in drowsiness than is otherwise accepted.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The mild shifting slowing is a nonspecific finding in an adult of this age and can be related to the patient's cognitive impairment or other age-related factors.  In this individual with multiple episodes which may be seizures, a repeat EEG or even more prolonged EEG recording may be of value.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 45-year-old woman with a strong family history of epilepsy, nocturnal tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonic jerks.  Vagal nerve stimulator.  There is a history of head trauma.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10-Hz alpha rhythm but there is a small amount of 7-Hz theta noted in the background.  Hyperventilation was performed early on in the record and produced an increase in theta.  As the patient transitioned in and out of stage 2 sleep, rare spike and slow-wave complexes were identified.  There was a burst of high-amplitude spike and polyspike activity in sleep which was generalized.  There was an additional subtle spike in sleep noted in the right frontal region.  Sleep was not sustained.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was transitioning in and out of sleep.  A photic driving response with harmonic and supraharmonic driving was observed but without spike and wave activity.  An additional burst of polyspike activity was noted as the patient was drifting off to sleep again at the end of photic stimulation.
Heart rate:  72 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized spike and wave activity as the patient transitioned in and out of sleep.
Polyspike and slow-wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings have previously been seen in this individual.  Although not many abnormalities were identified, most of them were
generalized, not focal.  These may be correlated with clinical history and imaging, but this EEG is more supportive of a primary rather than secondary generalized epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was not able to cooperate with formal testing during the EEG, is awake, and has continuous mouth movements, chewing on the ring on the left hand.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The current EEG is markedly abnormal, but includes a continuous pattern.  There is a paucity of cerebral activity in the posterior region and there is rhythmic theta and some alpha, and even some beta activity noted in the frontal region.  Prominent eye movement artifact is noted and there is prominent blinking as well.  There is an asymmetry noted in the record with a bit more frontal theta noted in the left frontal region, some of which includes a sharply contoured complex.  At times some of this a bit more symmetric.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at most reaches 6 Hz which appears to be reactive to eye opening in addition to normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation that produced no abnormal discharges.

Bursts of generalized slow spike and waves with frontal predominance and at times an asymmetric left predominant onset at a frequency of 2-2.5 Hz lasting up to 11 seconds that occurred multiple times during the recording.  At times the tech would try to verbally or physically touch the patient, and it was not clear if he would respond.
Focal sharp waves seen independently at F7/T3 in sleep. Some seen at F8/T4.
Focal slow waves seen occasionally at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording even in wakefulness.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with anterior temporal and single lead electrocardiogram electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, rifampin, simvastatin, evase (?), lisinopril, metformin, gabapentin, glipizide, ranitidine, carbamazepine, calcium.
HISTORY:  This is a 59-year-old woman with a history of epilepsy as well as childhood seizure and a previous craniotomy, left occipitoparietal craniotomy here with an EEG due to recurrent seizures.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some T3 and A2 electrode artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to diffusely slow background, however, in the limited wakefulness, she has a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  The patient does appear to go into stage I deeper stages and stage II deeper stages of sleep.  However, the architecture is slightly atypical.
Activating Procedures:  Specifically, hyperventilation accentuate the abnormal discharges which I will describe in the next paragraph.  However, photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal Discharges:
Focal sharp waves seen at T3, at times at T5 and sometimes at 01 occurring during sleep mainly, but sometimes during  wakefulness.
Focal sharp waves seen intermittently at T4.
Focal slow waves seen frequently at F7-T3, at T3, at T5 and at O1 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.   There is increased amplitude and increased frequency consistently with a breach rhythm over that region.
Focal slow waves seen at T4 intermittently at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Please note that the focal slowing at times occurs in burst lasting up to 5-6 seconds that appear to be very high amplitude and with intermixed sharp waves specifically over the left hemisphere.
Heart Rate:  84, regular.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left posterior quadrant sharp waves and frequent focal slowing associated with breach rhythm as well as right mid temporal sharp waves and focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction and irritability in the left posterior quadrant, which is consistent with a known lesion in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of right mid temporal focal cerebral dysfunction and irritability which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  Overall, this EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with multiple roci of irritability.  No clear seizures were seen during this recording.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 6-7 Hz in frequency and 30-50 microvolt in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  The background activity is characterized by delta activity with a frequency of 1.8-2.5 Hz frontally predominant delta activity intermixed with 5-6 Hz theta activity.  There are intermittent bursts of frontal intermittent delta activity, (FIRDA) seen with a frequency of 1-1.2 Hz and amplitude of 50-70 microvolt lasting for 2-3 seconds. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation result in no responses. Heart rate was 60 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to the slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm and background activity and the presence of FIRDA bursts during wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings could be due to metabolic encephalopathy, degenerative brain disease, increased intracranial pressure, or a deep midline lesion in the brain.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record. No seizures are captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.

MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat, Dilantin, phenobarbital, p.r.n. Valium.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation was not possible.  The patient was recorded in her specialized wheelchair.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  It lacks the normal developmental milestones for an adult of this age.  The background includes an occipitally predominant spike, which can be maximal on the left or right.  There is a suggestion at times of almost an alpha rhythm on the right when the left is demonstrating slower spike and wave activity, although the alpha frequency on the right may be a harmonic of the activity on the left.  Fast activity accompanies the occipitally predominant spike and wave activity.  The overall background is somewhat chaotic, with mixed-frequency arrhythmic delta and more rhythmic 4-5 Hz theta noted.  Bursts of paroxysmal fast activity are noted in the frontocentral region.
Spontaneous arousals were noted in the background, with the appearance of muscle artifact.  With these spontaneous arousals the patient looks about and the epileptiform activity abates.  Then, in relaxed wakefulness there is higher-amplitude occipitally predominant paroxysmal theta, some of which is sharply contoured and some of which has a more clear either fast activity in the right occipital region or a spike in the left occipital posterior temporal region.  As the patient transitions into sleep there are vertex waves, but again central paroxysmal fast activity was noted.  The patient transitions in and out of sleep.  There are some frontally predominant triangular-shaped waveforms noted as the patient transitions in and out of sleep, but the vast majority of the sharp waves is occipitally predominant in this EEG.
Photic stimulation did not clearly activate the record, although there was abundant epileptiform activity noted during photic stimulation.
Heart rate was 90 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to
Paucity of normal adult waveforms.
Occipitally predominant epileptiform activity, primarily on the left.
Paroxysmal rhythmic theta frequency activity of 5-6 Hz.
Rare triangular-shaped frontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG differs from a previous study of October 13, 2010, in that there is more significant epileptiform activity in the occipital regions.  The paroxysmal fast activity was not noted, but the paroxysmal theta was previously identified.
These findings may be correlated with imaging and clinical history.  Given the abundance of epileptiform activity noted in both EEGs, the two studies may represent the depth of epileptiform pathology for this complex patient.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Mother reported that the patient had a minor seizure the day before.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The right hemisphere lacks the normal developmental milestones for an adult of this age.  The left hemisphere demonstrates high amplitude epileptiform activity with high amplitude versus slowing and a discrete spike in the left hemisphere, this is nearly isoelectric at T1.  Using an average reference, this appears in the left hemisphere, maximum a bit anterior temporally with a poly spike component and a generous field is spread throughout the left hemisphere.  The epileptiform activity is always maximum on the left but with volume conduction appears in the right frontocentral region as well.  High amplitude bursts were noted as the patient was drifting off to sleep without clear clinical correlate.  Some discharges are maximum in the left frontal region and those are more likely to spread to the right.  In some sections of the record, there is a lower voltage beta pattern with some left frontal central theta.  Bursts of epileptiform activity may be brief lasting more than 2 seconds or more prolonged and seemed to increase as the patient drifts off to sleep.  Features of sleep include an increase in beta frequency activity.  Vertex waves were noted.  At the close of the record, the patient seemed to be drifting off to sleep with more of a theta frequency pattern.
Heart rate 108 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Prominent epileptiform activity primarily from the left hemisphere with a high amplitude on the left hemisphere slow spike, wave, and anterior temporal spike.
Left frontal spike.
Generalized background slowing.
A dynamic pattern with multiple different patterns including more of a theta pattern with focal slowing on the left.
Rare discrete sharp waves at T4
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function.  As was seen with previous EEG monitoring, the activity seems to be much more prominent from the left hemisphere.

There are intermittent bursts of left anterior to mid temporal slowing, 1.5-3 Hz frequency lasting for 1-2 seconds during drowsiness and wakefulness.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and resulted in no driving response.  Heart rate was 80 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through drowsiness due to the presence of intermittent left temporal slowing.  No epileptiform abnormalities or electrographic seizures were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings could be due to an underlying structural abnormality in the subcortical white matter of left hemispheres.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No epileptiform abnormalities or electrographic seizures were seen in this record.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If clinically indicated, a repeat sleep deprived EEG or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.

Mother reports increasing small seizures in the group home.  Recent homicidal behavior, 302 hospitalization for attempting to stab co-workers and room mate.  Impulse control disorder.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, zonisamide and Seroquel, clorazepate.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background rhythm is somewhat slow with the posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 6 Hz.  Occasional frontal spike and slow wave complexes are noted in hyperventilation.  Following hyperventilation, intermittent frontally predominant poly spike and slow wave complexes are noted in an overall slow background.  Some of these are a little bit more maximum on the right.  As the patient transitions to drowsiness, there is an increase in background slowing.  4-5 Hz poly spike activity or spike and wave activity is noted, but some of these are discreetly somewhat more prominent in the right frontal region than the left.  Others include a burst of fast activity which is in the frontal regions at the midline and may have more of a left frontal predominance.
Vertex waves were noted in sleep.  Bursts of very low voltage frontal paroxysmal fast activity were also noted in sleep.  Some vertex waves seem to phase reverse to the right of the midline.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was asleep.  While there was no driving, there may have been a slight accentuation of the paroxysmal fast activity and the poly spike activity, particularly with a 17 Hz stimulation.
Heart rate 108 bpm with a rapid heart rate even in sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Frontally predominant spike and wave and poly spike and wave activity.
Clinical correlation:  This EEG is better organized than a previous EEG recorded in 2010, but the epileptiform activity is similar.  Previous EEG monitoring in 2008 and 2010 have identified complex epileptiform activity similar to that described above.  Please refer to those reports for additional information.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of epilepsy since age 11.  Her seizures occur more frequently now and are largely nocturnal.
MEDICATIONS:  Diazepam, divalproex and zonisamide.
INTRODUCTION:  __________
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the record opens, there is a well-formed and symmetric 9 to 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm that is reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of frontocentral beta activity identified which is symmetrically distributed.  Stage 1 sleep is characterized by attenuation and fragmentation of the existing posterior dominant rhythm and the appearance of central theta activity.  Stage 2 sleep is not appreciated.
On at least 4 occasions during the record, there is the appearance of spike and wave discharges.  On at least 2 of these occasions, the discharges appear generalized with a bifrontal maximum.  These appear during periods of light drowsiness.  For approximately 3 to 4 seconds, there is a disruption of the background and the appearance of bihemispheric slowing superimposed upon which there is a sharply contoured activity.  There is, however, a definitive bifrontal generalized spike.  Later in the recording, there is a similar brief background slowing, and there is again bifrontal generalized spike and wave discharges.  These discharges are singleton events and thus it is difficult to determine what their frequency is.  On the third appearance, the spike wave discharges appears predominantly over the left frontal region and is maximal at FT7.  This discharge has the appearance more consistent with a localized focal spike in the left frontal region.
Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed in multiple flash frequencies and did not induce a significant photic driving response.  Of note, a photoparoxysmal response was not identified.  During the course of the recording, the heart rate varied between 70 and 90 beats.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG capturing wakefulness and drowsiness due to the presence of generalized bifrontal spike and wave discharges and a focal left frontal spike and wave discharge.
CLINICAL IMPRESSION:  The presence of bifrontal generalized spike-wave discharges may suggest an idiopathic generalized epilepsy in this patient.  The appearance of a focal spike in the left frontal region may suggest fragmentation of the generalized pattern during drowsiness but may also suggest the concomitant appearance of a generalized process plus a localized process, such as may be seen in __________ epilepsy or possibly in generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+).  Clinical correlation is advised.

Focal slow waves seen continuously at C44/F4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts with additional asymmetric increased amplitude and faster frequencies consistent with a breach.
SEIZURES:  Throughout the recording, there were about 6 seizures which appeared to have an electrographic onset, sometimes at O2 and at times at C4 beginning with high-frequency beta discharge that could again start on the occipital region or the central region and increase in frequency and then in amplitude, later to slow down in frequency but increase in amplitude and would spread either from the occipital region towards the central region at C4 or from the central region to the occipital region and continue to evolve.

There is excess 5-6 Hz theta activity during short periods of wakefulness.  There is low amplitude, generalized beta activity throughout the recording.  There are almost continuous bifrontal sharply contoured delta activity with a frequency of 2-3.5 Hz.  At times associated with occasional sharp and slow wave activity with no evolution.  There is also almost continuous delta activity noted in right temporal region.  Stage 1 sleep was seen as evidenced by vertex waves and posts.  Stage 2 sleep was seen as evidenced by sleep spindles and K complexes.  The heart rate was 80 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to:

Bifrontal slowing almost continuously with sharply contoured configurations.
Occasional bifrontal sharp and slow waves activities with no evolution.
Right temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Diffuse slowing and slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm are suggestive of metabolic toxic, anoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction.  Continuous slowing of bifrontal region is consistent with structural lesions in these regions.  The presence of sharp and slow waves is suggestive of underlying epileptogenicity.  Continuous slowing of temporal region is also consistent with a structural lesions in this area.  Generalized beta activity could be due to the effect of sedating medications including benzodiazepine or barbiturate or it can be seen in anxiety or hyperthyroidism.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No seizures were captured during this recording.

Following snoring, the patient was waking up with an actually a faster alpha rhythm of 7.5 Hz.
Photic stimulation did not significantly active the record.
Heart rate 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing with slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Shifting slowing.
Focal slowing in the right hemisphere which may be maximum at T4, the right parietal region or right temporal region.
Breach rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The background slowing is a nonspecific findings which can be seen in diffuse disturbance of cerebral function which may include significant head trauma, renal failure or other metabolic issues. This patient appears to be excessively sleepy and in fact, snoring produced an alerting response for this individual. Evaluation of this patient's neuro anatomy as well as other causes for hypersomnolence with important, given the prominent snore arousals. In comparison to the March 20, 2013, EEG, the focal slowing from the right has improved.

The family states that the patient usually has a postictal right hemiparesis.  Past history of significant traumatic brain injury.  The patient states that he does not take his seizure medication.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Just prior to the EEG, the patient was quite somnolent, but he became more awake as the EEG began.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG is diffusely slow with primarily a theta pattern.  There is an asymmetry noted, initially with a bit slower theta-delta on the left and a bit faster frequency activity of theta on the right.  The patient drifts in and out of a drowsy state.  He is not able to cooperate with hyperventilation.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is some sharply contoured slowing noted in the right anterior temporal region.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.  Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Excess theta.
An asymmetry with a slower background on the left.
Rare sharply contoured slowing in the right frontotemporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient with a history of traumatic brain injury and  asymmetry described above may be related to both the parenchymal pathology and the injury to the cranium.  No seizures were recorded.  Of note, the patient was a bit more awake at the end of the EEG, compatible with a resolving postictal state.

MEDICATIONS:  Spiriva, simvastatin, aspirin, levothyroxine, lisinopril, lorazepam, Zanaflex, and isosorbide.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 8.5-9 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is 6.5-7 Hz diffuse theta activity seen during wakefulness, which is distributed symmetrically.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm slowing of the background and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a driving response.  Heart rate was 80 beats per minute with pacemaker rhythm.
IMPRESSION:  This is this is an abnormal EEG recording due to diffuse slowing of the background with theta activity seen during wakefulness.  There is no epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were captured.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings could be due to metabolic, toxic, hypoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of sedating medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record.  No seizures were captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.  If clinically indicated, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was predominantly drowsiness and stage 1 sleep record with brief periods of wakefulness.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
MEDICATIONS:  Zonisamide, albuterol, Zyrtec.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:  The C3 CZ leads appear to have been closely placed because of which there is flattening of EEG in that channel.
HISTORY:  A 27-year-old lady who is mentally challenged, born out of complicated pregnancy, i.e. cesarean section and was born blue.  She was diagnosed with seizure disorder 1 year ago.  Per mother the patient has seizures every day with just eye twitching.  Also has left-sided twitching.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Periods of wakefulness were very brief as this was predominantly a sleep record.  In the brief period that the was awake there is diffuse slowing with a posterior dominant rhythm in the theta range with maximum frequency of 7 Hertz which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.
Sleep was characterized by diffuse slowing and some waves resembling vertex waves, but no definite vertex morphology was seen.  There were abnormal discharges seen during sleep which will be further described below under the section abnormal discharges.
Hypoventilation did not change the record significantly.
Photic stimulation did not elicit any abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized symmetric frontally predominant spike and wave activity of 2.5 Hertz frequency and 130 to 150 microvolt amplitude were noted mainly during drowsiness and sleep.
There was generalized diffuse slowing in the theta range.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Frontally predominant generalized symmetric 2.5 Hertz spike and wave discharges in sleep.
Symmetric diffuse slowing in the theta range.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 48-year-old lady who presented with acute respiratory distress.  The patient remained unresponsive, even after discontinuation of the fentanyl, for which an EEG was obtained.
MEDICATIONS:  Cefepime.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and 1-channel EKG.  Sleep and wakefulness were captured.  Activation procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG opens to a diffusely slow background in the delta range with a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 30 to 50 microvolts.  There is excess beta in the frontal leads.
The EEG is reactive to stimuli. There are clear state changes with some normal sleep elements which included occasional spindles.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
Abnormal discharges:
Diffuse slowing with 2 to 4 Hz frequency and 30 to 50 microvolts amplitude.
Frontally predominant triphasic waves seen frequently.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Diffuse delta range slowing.
Frontally predominant triphasic waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is non specific with regards to etiology. However, the presence of triphasic waves suggests that this may be due at least in part to metabolic dysfunction causing diffuse encephalopathy.  The presence of excess beta indicates that there might also be a component of medication-induced encephalopathy.  Clinical correlation is recommended.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This 84-year-old woman with posttraumatic epilepsy after MVA at age 11.  The patient recalls blackout spells, tonic-clonic seizures and occasional myoclonic jerks.  Epilepsy now pretty well controlled, seizure-free for a year, but with dementia and atherosclerosis.  Previously evaluated for status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra, Risperdal, donepezil, simvastatin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation are performed.  Hyperventilation was not possible.  This is an awake and asleep record.
TECHNICAL:  No significant issues.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall background in maximal wakefulness includes a glimpse of a 9 HZ rhythm but with generous data.  Focal slowing is noted, most particularly in the left mid temporal region with some rhythmic and arrhythmic mixed theta delta in the left temporal region.  In addition, in wakefulness, there are discrete left temporal sharp waves as well as TIRDA.  There is also some shifting slowing noted from the right hemisphere.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements, attenuation of the alpha rhythm, and more significant bursts of focal slowing on the left.  The patient was transitioned in and out of a drowsy state with an increase in beta.
Photic stimulation elicited a level that is driving response.
Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Left temporal focal slowing.
Left temporal discrete sharp waves.
Left temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.
Background slowing and disorganization.
Occasional bursts of slowing in contralateral hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is similar to a previous study which identified seizures from the left, but the overall background is, of course, markedly improved as the patient had not been in status epilepticus recently.
Overall, this EEG supports a focal mechanism for epilepsy on the left, but there are bihemispheric features which may represent age-related changes or bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 58-year-old man who was found down on the floor unresponsive with a finger stick of 25.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Zosyn, vancomycin, sildenafil.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed at patient's bedside.  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1/T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of periods of diffuse voltage attenuation lasting from several seconds to approximately 12-15 seconds, followed by progressive onset of bifrontal slow delta activity that increases in frequency and amplitude and spreads diffusely.  These episodes occur throughout the recording.  When the patient is stimulated diffuse voltage attenuation was achieved.  Due to the recurrent nature of these episodes, I suspect that these represent recurrent seizures.  No abnormal sleep architecture is captured.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
FINDINGS:  Status epilepticus.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 21-minute EEG due to suspected status epilepticus involving bifrontal regions.  However, at least on several occasions, during the recording this discrete EEG pattern could be elicited by stimulation.  Therefore, it is also possible that these episodes represent forms of reactivity.  The findings were communicated to the neurology consult team.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated and poorly responsive.
TECHNICAL:  This patient was in isolation due to fomites.  Consequently, the EEG machine was placed some distance from the patient and gloving and gowning was necessary to stimulate the patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal and includes rhythmic delta with FIRDA.  There are occasional triphasic waves noted in the EEG as well as shifting slowing.  Intermittent attenuations were noted.
Tactile stimulation of the patient on some occasions produced an alerting response with eye movement.  On some but not all occasions, tactile stimulation clearly reduced the FIRDA.  There is a handful of left frontal sharp waves noted in the record.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a markedly slow pattern.
FIRDA.
Triphasic waves.
Intermittent attenuations.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  A toxic or metabolic process or a deep brain stem process may contribute to this.  No clinical seizures were noted.  In contrast to the previous EEG, this patient was
not as responsive to tactile stimulation, but there was certainly evidence of responsivity and variability.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Central MU activity was noted, but testing was not performed to confirm this.  Hyperventilation was performed early in the record, producing some shifting slowing.   As hyperventilation continued, a burst of high amplitude rhythmic slowing from the left frontal region was identified.  No clinical correlates were noted.  This discharge was approximately 19 seconds in duration.  Of note, the burst of rhythmic slowing on the left seems to end over about 5 seconds and then a relatively normal awake pattern was noted.
In relaxed wakefulness, there is a mild degree of background slowing and as the patient transitions to drowsiness, there is very subtle underlying delta in the left hemisphere compared to the right.
Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was awake.  Although there was a driving response, the photic stimulation seems to accentuate some underlying focal slowing at T5.
Heart rate:  66 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Mild background disorganization in wakefulness.
Subtle focal slowing from the left.
Left posterior temporal slowing in photic.
Electrographic left hemisphere seizure in hyperventilation without clinical correlate.

INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to a standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.   Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  During maximal wakefulness, the posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 10.5 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, posterior dominant rhythm attenuates, bursts of centrally pronounced theta as well as diffuse delta are captured.  There are frequent multifocal epileptiform discharges.  They occur independently over the bitemporal regions with face reversal over T3 and T4 electrodes.  They also occur in moderate to high amplitudes 0.5 to 2 second runs of generalized frontocentral predominant spikes with __________slow waves.  The__________runs have either right or left-sided lead in and they are often poorly formed.  Hyperventilation is produced with fair effort and produces no significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetric occipital driving with multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
Epileptiform discharges found independently over bitemporal regions, with face reversal over T3 and T4 electrodes, as well as 0.5 to 2 second bursts of poorly formed, broadly based approximately 8.5 Hz generalized spike and wave discharges, that are more pronounced frontocentrally.
No electrographic seizures.  No stage II sleep.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 42-year-old man with a history of seizures since childhood, who now presents with increase in seizure frequency.  Seizures are characterized by change in mental status lasting approximately 10-20 seconds.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol and Depakote.
CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single lead EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The recording was performed continuously.  The recording was reviewed several times during the recording period.  The patient was equipped with an event button.  Pushbutton events were reviewed.  Medication staff notes and technician notes were reviewed as well.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude theta and delta activity.  Periods of sleep are brief and are characterized by symmetrical sleep spindles.  No electrographic seizures were captured.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing and disorganization.
No electrographic seizures.  Brief fragmented sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and asleep 7-hour continuous audio-video EEG recording due to moderate diffuse slowing and disorganization.  This finding indicates diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is etiologically nonspecific.  No electrographic seizures were captured.  These findings were conveyed to the neurology primary team.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 42-year-old man who seizures since childhood, who now presents with increase in seizure frequency.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Depakote, and Ativan given at an outside emergency room.
CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single lead EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude diffuse theta admixed with occasional delta.  During sleep, the degree of delta increases.  Brief bifrontal fast activity is captured.  A single electrographic seizure is captured.  Clinically, it occurs out of sleep when the technologist wakes up the patient for hyperventilation.  During the seizure, the patient does not respond and appears to have possible right hand systemic posturing.  Electrographically, there is rapid diffuse voltage attenuation and appearance of diffuse fast activity that is most pronounced bifrontally.  The seizure lasts approximately 35-40 seconds.  Hyperventilation is performed with poor effort and does not result in significant change in the background.  Photic stimulation does not result in additional abnormalities.
FINDINGS:
Mild to moderate diffuse slowing.
Occasional bifrontal brief fast activity.
A single clinical and electrographic seizure out of wakefulness of unclear lateralization, possibly bifrontal in onset.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 25-minute awake and asleep EEG due to mild to moderate diffuse slowing, bifrontal fast activity that is likely to be epileptiform in nature, and a single approximately 40 second seizure out of sleep of unclear lateralization, possibly frontal in onset.  Diffuse slowing indicates nonspecific cerebral dysfunction.   Epileptiform discharges and seizure indicate near cortical origin of the patient's epilepsy.  These findings were conveyed to the neurology primary team at the time of the review.

MEDICATIONS:  Depakote and Xanax.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  The recording began when the patient was drowsy but she was able to follow commands.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is diffusely slow with more of a theta pattern.  In addition, there is intermittent focal slowing from the right mid to posterior temporal region.
Hyperventilation was performed early in the record producing bursts of rhythmic frontal delta, as well as accentuating the focal slowing.  The patient transitions into stage 2 sleep with spindles.  In stage 2 sleep, there is some shifting slowing in the temporal regions.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting off to sleep and did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate: 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
A pattern of rhythmic background slowing.
Superimposed arrhythmic slowing in the right mid to posterior temporal region.
A handful of shifting bursts of shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The marked background slowing is a nonspecific finding and can be seen in a postictal state but does support a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  In comparison to previous EEGs, less epileptiform activity was noted.  The
focal slowing in the right temporal region is ipsilateral to the previous epileptiform activity.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  This EEG captures wakefulness through drowsiness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state the posterior dominant rhythm was 7-8 Hz in frequency, well formed on the left side and is disrupted at times on the right side.  It is seen in the occipital region which attenuates with eye opening.  There is diffuse excess theta activity during wakefulness in 6-7 Hz.  There is breach rhythm seen at the left mid and posterior temporal with raised sharp waves with no evolution.  There are bursts of right temporal slowing with a frequency of 5-6 Hz.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm and further slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  Heart rate is 70 beats per minutes and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to:
Slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
Excess diffuse theta during wakefulness.
Right temporal slowing during wakefulness.
Rare sharp waves seen arising from the left temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Breach rhythm is consistent with patient's history of right craniotomy.  Left temporal slowing seen at the right hemisphere is suggestive of an underlying structural abnormality in the subcortical white matter of the right hemisphere.  The sharp waves seen arising from the left temporal region is suggestive of epileptogenicity of the right temporal region.  Diffuse slowing is consistent with mild to moderate encephalopathy due to toxic, metabolic, degenerative, or postictal state.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
