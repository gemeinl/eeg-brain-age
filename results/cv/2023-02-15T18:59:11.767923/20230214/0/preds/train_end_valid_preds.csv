INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed.in lab using standard 20-20
system of electrode with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 30 Hz 30 microvolt alpha
rhythm with a slow amount of low voltage frontal central beta. Hyperventilation is
performed early on in the record producing a small amount of theta. Drowsiness is
characterized by an increase in background beta. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral
driving.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for an adult of this age with a relatively low voltage 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background and a small degree of slowing.  This is followed by drowsiness with rhythmic theta.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are identified.  In the context of generalized epilepsy in adulthood, epileptiform activity is sometimes elusive. This patient has not had epileptiform activity since 2004.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm.  On some occasions, the alpha rhythm is a little higher amplitude activity on the left than the right.  There is a bit of head rocking activity on the right compared to the left.  Hyperventilation is performed early in the record, producing an increase in theta.  Following this, as the patient becomes drowsy, the EEG is a bit more synchronous with higher amplitude and more anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Although there is some head rocking artifact in the background, there are no definitive focal or epileptiform features.  Given the head rocking artifact, a followup study, capturing extended sleep may be helpful in
characterizing epileptiform activity.  Alternatively, comparison with previous studies may also be valuable.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized with 9 Hz 40 mV alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing with a scant amount of shifting right or leg temporal isolette and focal slow waves. Hyperventilation also produces the background slowing. Additional features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  As the patient becomes drowsy there is a bit of head rocking artifact in the right posterior region.  A scant photic driving response was obtained.

Photic stimulation elicits driving at 1 Hz and faster flash frequencies with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.
HR:    60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No EEGs have ever demonstrated epileptiform activity for this patient.  The amplitude asymmetry identified in one of the 2005 EEGs may have been related to the patient's migraine history.  This is the fourth EEG for this patient and the third normal EEG.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  The patient's impedances were inappropriate, specifically in the occipital electrodes which caused some multi-electrode artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that appears to reach 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient had some normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures did not produce any abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep, stage I/stage II.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
One single sharp transient maximal at F3 seen in the recording while drowsy.
Occasional small amplitude sharp spikes seen at T3, only in stage I sleep, although not seen over T2.  The morphology is most consistent with benign epileptiform transients of sleep (BETS).
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal limited EEG with one suspicious left frontal sharp transient and BETS.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The significance of the left frontal sharp transient is unclear.  A repeated recording should be performed.  Particularly in this patient where the impedances and the quality of the recording was poor, it should be repeated free of charge.  The BETS are benign and do not indicate a high correlation with an epileptogenic focus in that region.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10-Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm with slow-rolling eye movements and central theta.  Stage II sleep was not sustained.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting in and out of sleep and did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The generous beta described above may represent this patient's medication effect or anxiety.  This is the third EEG for this patient without epileptiform activity.

Her last seizure was in September 2012.
MEDICATIONS:  The patient's medications include Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the laboratory using the standard International 10-20 System of electrode placement in addition to T1 and T2 electrodes and 1 channel of EKG monitoring, hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through drowsiness.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 10-11 Hz in frequency, 70-75 microvolts in amplitudes seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  Hyperventilation results in symmetrical slowing of the background activity.  Photic stimulation was performed and multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate is 60 to 70 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through drowsiness.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 31-year-old woman who presents with a history of generalized tonic/clonic convulsions associated with tongue biting and post-ictal confusion.  The last such event was on 1/7/2013.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Both hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consisted of a well-formed and modulated 10.5 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Hyperventilation was performed with fair effort and does not produce significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation does not result in occipital driving.  During sleep a burst of diffuse theta and delta activity, as well as symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, and POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep) are captured.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 22-minute electroencephalogram.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine electroencephalogram does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well-formed and modulated 9 to 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness, background attenuates but stage II sleep is not captured.  Hyperventilation was performed with poor effort and resulted in no change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in no clear occipital driving.  A single EKG lead demonstrates an irregularly irregular heart rate.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage II sleep.
Cardiac arrhythmia.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 24-minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persists, a repeat study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.  Cardiac arrhythmia is captured in the single EKG lead.

She presents to the hospital having visual and auditory hallucinations.
MEDICATIONS:  Glipizide, metformin, Cymbalta, Plavix, HIV medications.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10/20 system with addition of T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG leads.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 9-10 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  A stage 1 sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact, as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and posts.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in no driving response.  Heart rate was 80 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through stage 1 sleep.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or of intermittent seizures.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a long-term EEG monitoring may be helpful.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 36-year-old man with a history of seizures since childhood, with no seizures in the last several years.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamotrigine, Topamax, Fosamax, vitamin D, calcium and others.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well-formed and modulated 9 Hz moderate amplitude alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and symmetrical vertex waves are observed.  Hyperventilation was performed and the results have no significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a normal cardiac rhythm.
FINDINGS:
No stages of sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 22 minutes EEG.  When compared to the EEG from 04/25/2008, epileptiform discharges seen over the right posterior temporal region are not captured on this study.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  If clinical indication for seizures persist, a repeat study with stage 2 sleep may be of benefit.
