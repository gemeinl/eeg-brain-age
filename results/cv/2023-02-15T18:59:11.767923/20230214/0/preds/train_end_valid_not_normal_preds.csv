INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Patient is intubated and is being evaluated for status epilepticus.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This acute emergency room record demonstrates a markedly abnormal but dynamic pattern. As the tracing begins, the overall background is slow, even slightly discontinuous. There is an area in the right hemisphere of irregular epileptiform activity with sharp waves or spikes maximum at T6 P4 02 but with variability. There is even a spike that starts posteriorly and then demonstrates spread to T4 T6. Some of the discharges are followed by right frontally predominant rhythmic delta. As the recording continues, there is less
in the background suppression following the spikes,  the epileptiform activity is present but does
not build up into bursts and the overall background is more continuous. In addition, at the end of the record, it is returned mixed frequency activity.

HR:	N/A


IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1.	A complex, polyphasic epileptiform discharge in the right posterior quadrant with variable maximum.
2. 	Right frontotemporal delta.
3. 	Background slowing.
4. 	Intermittently discontinuous record.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports an irritative process. In addition, there is focal slowing and bilateral background slowing. Correlation with clinical history is recommended.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens the patient seems quite
nervous with frequent eye blink. The alpha rhythm does achieve 8.5 Hz.
Hyperventilation is performed early in the record producing an increase in slowing of the
background. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. This record does contain somewhat
more 7-8Hz activity than would be normally anticipated In an adult of this age.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 44 year old right handed male with a traumatic brain injury December
2008, subsequently developing epilepsy, last seizure 2 weeks ago. Bilateral frontal skull
defects.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are
performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10Hz posterior dominant
rhythm. There is a scant amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Stage II sleep includes
some slightly irregular vertex and spindle activity, congruent with the patient's previous
craniotomy. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. Following photic stimulation as the patient becomes drowsy there is a prominent increase in beta.
Hyperventilation accentuates some of the frontal theta.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild excess frontal theta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The craniotomy findings such as the breech rhythm are normal
finding after craniotomy. There is a small amount of excess theta. Overall, this EEG is
improved compared to a previous study dated 6/24/2009. Neither study demonstrated
epileptiform activity. In this individual with continued seizures, a more prolonged study
capturing deeper stages of sleep may be helpful to characterize epileptiform activity.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow and disorganized. In addition, superimposed upon this are bursts of arrhythmic and rhythmic theta and delta, maximum in the right temporal regions but sometimes seen in isolation on the left. The later sections of the recording including drowsiness include frontally-predominant 3-4 Hz high amplitude activity with a suspicious underlying right frontal sharp wave.

1. Replacement of normal background with a low voltage, beta pattern.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform seizures were identified. This is a markedly abnormal pattern. Considerations for diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as well as exposure to a medication which would produce beta activity should be considered. In comparison to previous studies during this individuals hepatic encephalopathy, this pattern demonstrates worsening of the background slowing.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.8 Hz alpha rhythm. There is
prominent, shifting arrhythmic delta activity in the temporal regions. During hyperventilation, there is a brief run of right temporal sharp waves. This is followed by some bitemporal sharp activity. The overall background demonstrates generate.s beta. Primarily in wakefulness there is occasional left temporal delta, but stage 2 sleep is relatively synchronous with symmetric vertex waves, spindles, and K-complexes. Photic stimulation is performed with the patient initially asleep with some shifting asymmetries, but when awake there is a driving response and then another burst of right temporal sharp waves.

The pattern includes some frontally predominant triphasic waves which improve over time and bilateral generalized periodic epileptiform discharges. Focal sharp waves are seen in the left posterior temporal region at T3 and T5, but those are improving to some extent during the course of the record. Over the course of the record there is an increase in spontaneous arousals which are associated with muscle artifact. The discontinuity improves and the triphasics resolve, but the overall starts out with a markedly slow delta/theta pattern and transitions to a very slow, but with increasing theta quantity pattern.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a mixed frequency pattern
with generous delta and smaller amounts of theta. The most notable features about this record include focal slowing in the right hemisphere with arrhythmic delta and nearly continuous, somewhat periodic sharp waves in the right hemisphere with variable maximum and a generous field of spread. Using an average reference they appear to be maximum at 02, but there is generous involvement at C4, T6, and P4. There is a somewhat unusual dipole and there is variability in the discharges. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta.

Some of these are more prominent in the right compared to the left. The FIRDA is more prominent as the individual becomes drowsy. She seems to be inattentive, intermittently alerting and looking about. This pattern is followed by some frontal delta. Lambda is observed. The patient is carefully monitored by a nurse and the technologist during the study.
HR: 120 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed today. When the patient is cooperative, it may be important to reassess the background. The patient's current mental state, however, is not ictal although it may be toxic or metabolic or postictal.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient is cooperative.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern. There are brief sections of the record where the EEG is medium amplitude, reasonably well organized with a 6 hertz background. This is disrupted by bursts of rhythmic, frontally predominant delta. In addition, there is arrhythmic delta activity sometimes identified in the occipital scalp region. There are shifting asymmetries but some of the arrhythmic delta activity is higher amplitude on the left compared to the right. Within the bursts of delta, there are subtle, slow, frontal spike and slow wave complexes. The epileptiform activity is not as prominent as the frontal delta. Hyperventilation produces prominent bursts of delta. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a 1-hour EEG. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the overall background EEG is reasonably well organized with a 10.3 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of shifting slowing. Notable in this record are just prior, during, and after hyperventilation are bursts of high amplitude frontally predominant 3-5 Hz spike and slow wave complexes. These are high amplitude, frontally predominant, symmetric, and typically occur in bursts lasting 2 seconds, but up to 3 seconds. They are symmetric, bifrontal, with a polyspike component. Features of drowsiness include vertex waves. K-complexes are noted in stage 2 sleep. Dyshormia is noted as the patient transitions into sleep. In the transition to and from sleep there is some isolated high amplitude or more subtle spike and wave complexes also observed.
Photic stimulation is remarkable for a driving response. In addition, just following 11 Hz spike and wave activity and in the intermediate/frequencies, such as 17 Hz, spike and wave activity is observed.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Frontally predominant spike and wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is significantly different from the initial EEG November 4, 2009 which did not identify generalized spike and wave activity. In that study, hyperventilation was not performed. This EEG is much more supportive of a generalized and focal mechanism for epilepsy. It is also different in that there is no generalized background slowing noted today.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient reports that she has not experienced a seizure in 3 days and feels normal on the day in question.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, there is an abnormality in the record with a repetitive spike or sharp wave in the right occipital region. This is seen almost at 3 to 5 Hz in frequency. It averages a little more than 3 Hz with a peak of 70 microvolts in the background. This accompanies primarily alpha and theta frequency background with a suggestion of an alpha rhythm on the left of approximately 7.3 Hz, but there is also some 8.5 Hz activity in the background noted. The occipital spiking Is nearly continuous throughout the record. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. The right occipital 02 spike waxes and wanes. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving on the left and does not seem to impact the right occipital spiking. At the end of photic stimulation, however, the spiking seems to be slowing to below 3 Hz.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Nearly continuous right occipital spike activity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings were discussed with the patient. This EEG supports a highly irritative focus in the right occipital cortex.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record and faster frequency activity is disrupted in the right before the left. In addition, in the transition to drowsiness, faster frequency activity also drops out on the right compared to the left. There is rare isolated focal slowing in the right temporal region. In addition, there is some artifact almost always seen with the EKG but there is a suggestion of a right temporal sharp wave. However, only on one occasion can a sharp wave be identified in the right frontotemporal region, independently of the EKG artifact. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated with a ventriculostomy. She had previously been responsive. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a markedly abnormal pattern. The activity from the left hemisphere is markedly suppressed and slow. There is a breach rhythm identified on the right. In addition, throughout much of the record the activity is quite slow in the right frontal region but there is some beta accentuation in the right frontal region as well as a somewhat periodic sharp wave maximum at 4. Stimulation of the patient does produce some artifact as well as a small amount of rhythmic activity in the right hemisphere but this is difficult to discern at the left hemisphere and at both hemispheres, the use of slow paper speed is necessary to see changes. There is variability in the right hemisphere.

HR: 100 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Markedly slow background.
2. Intrahemispheric asymmetry with a markedly slow pattern on the left.
3. Occasional periodic sharp waves on the right in the right frontal region.
4. Variability with occasional prominent beta activity in other sections with more of a delta pattern.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function. The periodic sharp waves identified at F4 could be generated from the cerebral activity on the left given the degree of herniation noted on the CT scan. No seizures were seen. Overall, this is a very ill-appearing pattern.

MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Baclofen, Gabapentin, Risperdal, METFORMIN, Lisinopril, Microgestin, Benztropine, Chlorpromazine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is awake but is suffering from a cold. Hyperventilation is deferred. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates primarily a theta frequency with 6-7 Hertz theta in the background and a 7-8 Hertz alpha rhythm. There is an amplitude asymmetry with higher amplitude in the left hemisphere compared to the right. There is some arrhythmic delta activity particularly the left posterior quadrant. Features of drowsiness include rhythmic background slowing, occasional vertex waves and some Firda. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
HR: 96bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG is abnormal due to:
1. Left hemisphere demonstrates mild slowing of the alpha rhythm.
2. Right hemisphere a bit more slowing and a little bit more arrhythmic delta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: None of this patient's EEGs have ever demonstrated significant epileptiform activity, however, this is the best quality record to-date. That study failed to identify epileptiform activity in association with the spells. This is one of many EEGs and is the best quality of all of her studies.

questionable drop attacks.

MEDICATIONS: Unknown, none listed

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern.
Some sections are low voltage with a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz and some generous
beta and some theta. Other sections include more of a theta frequency background. There are sustained bursts of rhythmic, sharply contoured 5 Hz paroxysmal activity maximal in the frontal regions. Some of these seem to have frequency of late evolution. Some seem to start with a sharp wave in the right or left frontal region. On one occasion, one of these more sustained bursts seems to be associated with startling and the patient puts her hand over her mouth. On other occasions, however, it is difficult to say that the bursts are associated with any change in behavior. The technologist taps the patient during one of the events and the patient alerts and the 5 Hz activity disappears.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. An unusual pattern with an almost normal-appearing background alternating with a beta
theta pattern.
2. Paroxysmal bursts of higher amplitude activity in the frontal regions which demonstrate
frequency evolution with 5 Hz activity evolving to 8 Hz and then slowing as the discharges wane.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: I n this challenging patient, the possibility that at least some of
these bursts can represent subtle seizures Is Important to consider. This EEG supports a diffuse
disturbance of cerebral function and the ictal pattern Is one seen in a chronic, static
encephalopathy emanating from a pediatric pattern.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is quite somnolent. No clinical seizures are noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern.
Much of the record includes an intra hemispheric asymmetry with a slower pattern on the left compared to the right. There are other portions, however, where there is more focal delta on the right compared to the left. There are sections of the record where a 6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm is beginning to emerge from the right occipital region. Most of the features on the left include arrhythmic delta or semirhythmic delta, some of which is sharply contoured in the left hemisphere. There are rare sharp waves noted from the left frontal region. Occasional more rhythmic slowing is noted from the right with rare right centrotemporal sharp waves. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 1. Slowing which can be identified from either hemisphere which can be quite sustained.
2. Rare sharp waves Including right centrotemporal and left frontal
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The overall background is markedly improved. This EEG is
supportive of a bihemispheric disturbance. The pattern is somewhat unusual and interesting, but the correlation with imaging may be helpful in terms of the appearance or epileptiform activity which was previously right frontal when the patient had massive left-to-right herniation and is now more of a right centrotemporal focus.

IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild background slowing and disorganization.
2. A subtle asymmetry with dropout of the alpha rhythm on the right before the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no definitive epileptiform features. The background slowing is nonspecific and can be seen in toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, post ictal state or other mild diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. The alpha asymmetry is a subtle finding, but the alpha rhythm is lower amplitude on the right compared to the left. These findings may be correlated with imaging.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old woman with carotid disease, prior CVA with progressive encephalopathy following orthopedic surgery.

MEDICATIONS: Morphine, Lovenox, Percocet, Tylenol

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and
includes a rhythmic mixture of delta and theta frequency activity.

There is a frontally predominant periodic complex which is asynchronous. The field for the discharge is unusual and in the right frontal region, it has an anterior to posterior lag as a triphasic wave might have, but is not identical in the left hemisphere and using an average reference, it is most prominent in the frontal regions FP1 and FP2 with an anterior to posterior lag. In some cases, it is maximum at FP1, clearly higher amplitude and on other occasions, a bit more prominent at FP2. Initially, stimulation of the patient produces an increase in muscle.

Ativan is given during the EEG and produces a slowing of the background. After the Ativan, the periodic activity begins to abate and is most prominent in the right frontal region.

At 12:23:40, the periodic activity to abruptly terminates and the EEG transitions to a alpha theta background. Following the Ativan the EEG was improved dramatically.

HR: 76 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Triphasic waves
3. Complex periodic activity some of which appears to be epileptiform in nature, but others which are more focal and have unusual morphology.


CLINICAL CORRELATION: Features of this record support a metabolic encephalopathy, however, the dramatic improvement with the use of benzodiazepine suggest that the discharges are more likely to represent a late form of status epilepticus.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is poorly responsive. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern. There are sections of the record rich in 6 Hz to 8 Hz activity. The patient seems to be poorly interactive with frequent eye blink artifact. In addition to the eye blink, there are occasional frontally predominant triphasic waves and some FIRDA. Unfortunately, a significant portion of the record includes muscle. Interaction with the patient does not clearly change the record. It is more of a dynamic pattern with bursts of delta followed by more of an alpha theta frequency pattern and the occasional triphasic waves.

HR: 84 bpm

IMPRESSION: Markedly improved but abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Paroxysmal delta.
3. Occasional triphasic waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting gray and white matter. In contrast to the previous study, there is less in the way of triphasic waves, although there is eye blink artifact, there are not bursts or trains or periodic sharp waves although given the patient's muscle artifact, subtle epileptiform activity would be overlooked. A followup study may be of value.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a relatively slow pattern from both hemispheres with primarily a theta frequency background. Persistent periodic complexes are identified from the left hemisphere with a complex field of spread. The activity seems to be negative in the left frontal region with a positive phase reversal in the left parietal region. On some occasions it seems like the positivity in the parietal region precedes the negativity in the left frontal area. There is a little bit of variability in this, and there is also what seems to be a discrete area of fast activity in the left central parietal region. This activity does not evolve.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a dramatic intrahemispheric asymmetry. The activity from the left is essentially suppressed. The right hemisphere demonstrates primarily a theta frequency pattern. There is some assault and a significant EKG artifact, but no sharp waves. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity on the right. There are rare bursts of broad, sharply contoured delta from the right. There is intermittent delta on the right, in addition to the primarily theta frequency activity. Arousals are noted with an increase in alpha theta on the right.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked intrahemispheric asymmetry.
2. A moderately slow pattern on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were noted. No seizures were recorded. It is not clear if the patient's facial twitching did occur during the EEG.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a diffuse beta frequency background. Some sections of the record demonstrates a bit more alpha frequency activity. Hyperventilation is performed, but the patient is falling asleep with vertex waves in hyperventilation. As he drifts off in and out of the sleep state, there is a 10 hertz activity identified in the frontal regions. Maximum FP1, FP2 and F3. A positive vertex sharp wave is noted in the background. The patient is drifting off in and out of stage 1 to stage 2 sleep during photic stimulation. Trains of POSTS are noted in and out of the sleep state. The overall background is relatively sharply contoured. There is some shifting slowing in the posterior regions noted in some sections of the record.
HR: N/A
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess theta
2. Shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are a number of unusual waves forms noted in this record, but there are no definitive epileptiform features. The background slowing may be part of this patient's underlying epilepsy but his multisystem dysfunction may also contribute to the pattern. In comparison to prior EEGs, there is less epileptiform activity.

MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Keppra,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a prolonged study for a patient who appeared to have had a subclinical seizure. She was confused during the EEG and somewhat lethargic.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. The background from the right hemisphere is slow and disorganized. The left hemisphere includes a high amplitude breech rhythm with a left frontal sharp and slow complex with arrhythmic delta activity.
At 9:15 the patient is relatively inattentive and the technologist wraps the head. At some point essentially continuous spiking is noted in the left frontal region.
A seizure is identified at 9:19 characterized by evolution of epileptiform activity in the left frontal region, which is high amplitude with a generous field of spread. The seizure duration is from 19:13:30 to 19:19:59 suggesting that this is a relatively brief seizure. The technologist transitions from this to additional recording at 09:21. After the first event with impaired responsiveness, high amplitude left frontal spiking is noted with a breech rhythm in the abnormal background. The patient's mental status actually improves somewhat. She moves about, although she is confused. The activity remains quite slow in both hemispheres.
There was another brief build up again at 9:40. Artifacts are picked up at 9:35, but again there is prominent spiking in the background with very prominent epileptiform activity.
A third electrographic seizure occurs at 9:58:57. The patient is relatively somnolent. Stimulation of the patient does not occur during this testing, but the seizure stops by itself and as it does the patient moves about.
By the morning of the 7th, she is more consistently awake, out of bed with more rhythmic theta frequency in the background although the patterns in both hemispheres are slow.
Throughout the record, there are intermittent bursts of rhythmic delta which do not have a clear clinical correlate.
Seizure: The patient is in bed and she has just off the monitor. Her head is off the monitor. She appears to be sleepy. At  13:35 she was awake and the seizure is 12 minutes later. At 13:44 with the patient with someone at the bedside, in fact a physician examining her, the left frontal delta is prominent as are some sharp waves but she is interactive somewhat with the individual examining her. As the student leaves, the patient drifts over to the right.
The electrographic seizure is at 13:47:13 and the patient is not really moving during the event but starts to reposition afterwards.
This event is characterized by rhythmic, faster frequency activity in the left frontal and temporal region with also a beta accentuation.
After the seizure was over, the patient looks about.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal continuous EEG monitoring due to:
1. Well-defined electrographic seizures noted but with only one seizure In the last 24 hours of recording.
2. Left frontotemporal focus.
3. Focal slowing from the left.
4. Generalized background slowing quite marked in the beginning of the record but better at the close of the record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of a localization-related
mechanism for epilepsy. Additional recording may be appropriate if this patient's mental status does not improve.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: This section of EEG, which includes a routine 20 minute EEG, followed by 50 minutes of recording, includes multiple, brief complex partial seizures. Although the patient's mental status is abnormal, the clinical correlate for this patient's seizures includes impaired responsiveness.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG is performed in the LTM unit using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement. The patient has a pattern of improving mental status over the course of the day. She, unfortunately, eliminated her EEG electrodes during the overnight recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Despite the improved clinical appearance of the patient, there are electrographic seizures identified. These occur when the patient is in bed sleeping, without clinical correlate. They are associated with runs and bursts of activity.
Time: 19:0838 - Approximately 1 minute in duration.
Time: 19:5442 - Another seizure, maximum, in the left frontal and temporal region with a generous field of spread. Of note, the majority of the electrographic seizures are at approximately 8 p.m. and shortly thereafter the patient starts to remove the EEG electrodes. Of note, however, the patient did receive Versed in the morning and although there were frequent high amplitude left frontocentral sharp waves, the
recurrence of seizures was primarily many hours afterwards.
INTERVAL IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: Electrographic seizures for this individual were well-defined with characteristic frequency evolution despite the prominent interictal sharp waves from the left frontocentral region and frontotemporal region.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. At least one electrographic seizure is noted but no clinical seizures are observed. The patient's mental status gradually improves over the course of the record with the patient able to eat and get out of bed as well as participate in care.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial sections in this epoch include a markedly slow pattern with slower delta and rhythmic theta frequency from both hemispheres and high amplitude sharp and slow or spike and slow wave complexes, many of which are frontotemporal but some of which are T1. The patient is certainly much sleepier on the 6th compared to the 7th.
By the morning of the 7th, she is more consistently awake, out of bed with more rhythmic theta frequency in the background although the patterns in both hemispheres are slow.
Throughout the record, there are intermittent bursts of rhythmic delta which do not have a clear clinical correlate.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is a relatively rhythmic slow theta pattern with frequent eye blink. When the patient is resting comfortably, there is primarily rhythmic frontal theta activity. Frontal delta is noted bilaterally, which is higher amplitude on the left than the right, and there is a notched or suspicious left frontal sharp wave.

MEDICATIONS: Lamictal
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is primarily awake, poorly interactive. Photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is awake with primarily a pattern with generous, diffuse beta, some underlying more rhythmic 3 Hz to 4 Hz activity and intermittent, paroxysmal bursts of 11 Hz activity. In addition, there are also bursts of more sharply contoured, 5 Hz activity in the background which is bilaterally present, frontally predominant.
Photic stimulation is performed early in the record and may, in fact, accentuate some paroxysmal frontal beta and the 5 Hz theta frequency activity. Although it is difficult to completely assess the patient, there may be an 11 Hz alpha rhythm in the background versus part of the entire background. In terms of eye opening and eye closure, there is no consistent pattern that suggests an alpha rhythm but this is a difficult to evaluate, handicapped young woman.
The individual remains awake throughout much of the record with primarily a beta and theta pattern without the additional paroxysmal bursts of 5 Hz or 11 Hz activity or without so many of the additional bursts of paroxysmal activity. At the close of the record, again, paroxysmal approximately 12 Hz activity is observed in the background. The primary peak is really at 11 Hz overall and there may have been a beta buzz of 22  Hz activity just prior to the 11 Hz activity.
HR: 84bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Paucity of the normal background rhythms for a 19-year-old female.
2. Primarily a theta pattern with some beta activity.
3. What is likely a paroxysmal pattern with both 5 Hz activity and 11 Hz activity and some 22 Hz activity
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is more compatible with a generalized mechanism for seizures. It is similar to previous studies and carries some feature similar to her siblings pattern. No clinical seizures were recorded. If drop attacks are frequent, additional EEG recording may be of use.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. The patient was actually drowsy during the acquisition of the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Although the patient is drowsy throughout much of the record, there are brief sections when there is a low voltage and with some theta and delta. During wakefulness, the patient also exhibits some prominent epileptiform features that are identified during this record. As the tracing begins, there is some right central temporal region sharps and also some spike in wave activity that generates some beta bursts. These are well formed and they are accompanied by after going slow wave. There are actually no clinical symptoms associated with this activity and no additional epileptiform activities are observed.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Epileptiform activity from the right hemisphere with some bursts of sharp waves in the right side that also are seen in the central temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is supportive of a secondary generalized mechanism for epilepsy. There are focus of epileptiform activity seen and identified suggesting a complex mechanism for this individual with epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is somewhat confused.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Although the patient is able to answer questions, the background EEG is markedly abnormal. The left hemisphere is somewhat lower voltage. The right hemisphere includes a rhythmic delta activity with a high amplitude spike and slow wave complex in the right frontocentral region with some variability typically C4.
When the patient is asked to count to 10, 8 Hz activity appears out of the right hemisphere. At one point, the pattern almost looks like an alerting but at another point during this, it almost looks as if an ictal pattern is generated during this testing. There is variability in the record with some sections demonstrating more alpha frequency activity than others. The right hemisphere demonstrates a significant breech rhythm.
The spike and wave activity has a slower periodicity demonstrating some waxing and waning but its alpha theta frequency activity which may represent an ictal pattern for this individual versus an arousal. Photic stimulation does not clearly activate the record.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Prominent epileptiform activity in the right central region.
2. Questionable subclinical seizures characterized by more rhythmic delta theta from the right and/or perhaps a pattern of more rhythmic alpha theta frequency activity.
3. Relatively lower voltage featureless pattern on the right.
4. Breech rhythm with much higher amplitude activity on the right

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow and disorganized. There is a great deal of EKG artifact picked up throughout the record . There are bursts of frontal delta and there are also some bursts of sharply contoured right occipital rhythmic delta noted. That delta is approximately 3Hz. Because of the degree of muscle and movement artifact this is a very challenging EEG and epileptiform activity, particularly i1the central and temporal regions. particularly on the right, may have been overlooked. There is a suggestion of some frontal sharp activity more so on the left than the right but again there is significant difficulty in terms d artifact. As the patient drifts off to sleep there are sharply contoured frontal waves noted and the suggestion of an underlying sharp wave in the right hemisphere, which may start frontotemporally  and then migrate posteriorly. Additional areas of concern are also obscured by the EKG artifact,which is substantial in this record The patient is drowsy throughout much of the record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is a small amount of .background theta. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record. This accentuates focal slowing from the left temporal region. In addition, it also accentuates left anterior temporal spike and slow wave and sharp and slow wave complexes, maximum at T1 or F7.

MEDICATIONS:  Banzel, Potassium, Norvasc, Vimpat, Levetiracetam
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The patient is awake,
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal and opens almost with an ictal pattern with rhythmic high amplitude 3 hertz activity in the right posterior quadrant occipital temporal with generous field of spread. Hyperventilation produces an increase in rhythmic delta activity and in fact, seems to generate a seizure during hyperventilation although no clinical symptoms are reported in this non-English speaking adult. The tech does ask the patient, ""how are you feeling"" and he reports that he ""feels okay during the discharge.""  The remainder of the EEG demonstrates a slow disorganized pattern with rhythmic theta and delta activity with nearly continuous rhythmic sharply contoured activity in the right hemisphere particularly posterior quadrant, mid to posterior temporal. Photic stimulation does not produce a driving response.
HR:    120 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Seizure from the right hemisphere particularly mid to posterior temporal region with waxing and waning epileptiform activity.
Sharp waves from the right hemisphere including occipital or posterior temporal.
Marked background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is one of many patterns for this individual. It is a much more focal pattern than his recent studies have demonstrated.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is very sleepy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates primarily stage I and stage II sleep.  As the patient transitions in and out of stage I and II sleep, there is some arrhythmic delta.  Although there is somewhat insignificant EKG artifact, there are some sharp waves in the left mid-temporal region. Vertex waves, K-complexes, and spindles characterize stage II sleep. In the transition in and out of sleep, the focal slowing from the left temporal region is a bit more prominent.  Some of the sharp waves have a significant posterotemporal distribution and are seen with the emergence from sleep.  Photic stimulation does not significantly produce a driving response, but also seems to accentuate the focal slowing and sharp waves in the left temporal region.  Photic stimulation was, however, an alerting response.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left temporal sharp waves and intermittent left temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural or functional abnormality on the left as well as a localization related mechanism for seizure.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional EKG and anterior temporal electrodes.  The patient was lethargic and obtunded where recorded.  No activating procedures were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording opens to a diffusely slow EEG with no posterior dominant rhythm, no frontal central beta seen.  No normal sleep architecture is seen and no activating procedures are performed.  During the recording, the patient receives stimulation, which reveals no change in the frequency or pattern of the EEG.

There are a handful of subtle underlying sharp waves noted in the right hemisphere, particularly frontal central. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Slow and disorganized background.
Shifting slowing particularly in the right posterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Epileptiform activity was not particularly prominent in this record.  The overall pattern is one of shifting slowing with more disruption of faster
frequency activity on the right compared to the left.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation are performed. There is a fair amount of muscle artifact, more the left than the right.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is low attenuating amplitude with a 10.7 Hz alpha rhythm. This may be subtly disrupted on the left but unfortunately there is also a bit more muscle artifact there. As the patient transitions toward drowsiness, there is occasional rhythmic or arrhythmic mixed theta/delta noted on the left. Photic stimulation elicits a bilateral driving response, but that driving response is better developed on the right compared to the left.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Subtle disruption of the alpha rhythm on the left, seen as intermittent finding.
2. Occasional mixed theta or delta noted from the left hemisphere particularly in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These are subtle features and may be correlated with this patient's imaging and clinical history. No epileptiform features were noted.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a symmetric 10 reactive Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.  The waking background is well organized.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in background slowing, particularly in the posterior regions.  In this sharply contoured background, there are underlying sharp waves in the right central temporal region.  There is prominent wicket noted.  The sharp waves occur in a sharply contoured background.  They occur when the patient transitions towards more of a relaxed wakefulness state.  As she drifts off to sleep there is subtle slowing in the posterior regions, a bit more so on the right compared to the left.  Vertex waves are noted in sleep.  Some of these are a bit asymmetric, better developed on the left.
HR:   72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Unusual, right mid temporal to posterior temporal or central temporal periodic sharp waves which were actually picked up in relaxed wakefulness, but not in deeper stages of sleep.
Subtle asymmetries with a bit of disruption of faster frequency activity and a bit of delta seen occasionally from the right.
A handful of bilaterally predominantly, almost a posterior triphasic-like wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings may be correlated with imaging.  The right posterior temporal sharp waves support a focal mechanism or seizures.  The posteriorly predominant triphasic wave appearing discharge may represent a pled-like phenomenon or a metabolic phenomenon.  No seizures were recorded.  The overall background is very well organized.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly slow. It is a mixture of delta and theta frequency activity. The activity is somewhat more suppressed on the right compared to the left and the right is lower voltage. The left hemisphere demonstrates well defined T1 spike and slow or sharp and slow wave complexes noted as the recording continues. As the recording continues, the patient is awake with eye opening and occasional movements.
The sharp waves and spikes tend to occur as pairs with a brief train of sharp waves and spikes noted at 11:1329. This is followed by an arousal, but no definitive seizures. As the patient drifts back toward sleep, there is a mixture of theta and delta and less eye movement. Occasional automatisms in chewing are noted, but no seizures are recorded.

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video long-term EEG was performed at bedside using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.  Continuous spike detection software as well as alarm and nurses' notes were used to review the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts.  There is frontocentral beta seen.  No abnormal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures are performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves/PLEDS at FP1 at 1 to 2 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 70 microvolts seen almost continuously throughout the recording, although by the last 24 hours the frequency had diminished and they were only seen in some spurts with inter bursts of more than 10 seconds.  The morphology at the end of the recording was a lot more blunt and of lower amplitude.
Generalized slow waves.
SEIZURES:  During the recording, the patient would have, at the FP1 electrode, rhythmic discharges that would increase in frequency and decrease in amplitude, and then suddenly stop multiple times per hour for the first 10 hours.  Suddenly they subsided and stopped, and for the rest of the recording none were seen.  During the ones that occurred at the beginning of the recording, no clear clinical correlation was noted.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Seizures from the left prefrontal region which subsided after the first 10 hours, and none were seen for the last 50 hours of recording.
Focal sharp waves/PLEDS seen in the left prefrontal region.
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of acute structural dysfunction and irritability arising from the left prefrontal region which has a high correlation with an acute structural lesion in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of seizures arising from the same region for the first 10 hours of the recording and none seen in the next 50 hours.  There is also evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology and is likely due, at least in part, to medication effect.  These changes were noted to the primary team during the recording.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing and frontal alpha.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  The frontal alpha in the setting of infarction is sometimes seen in alpha coma; however, the fact that the patient may be following commands is suggestive of a much better prognosis, this is likely related to medications affect.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was unresponsive during the exam.  No activating procedures other than ocular stimulation and peripheral stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  When stimulated, there is no change on the recording.  There is otherwise a very low amplitude diffusely slow recording.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
There is focal slowing continuously seen at F7/T3 throughout the recording.
Generalized slow waves and low amplitude.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing in the left frontal region.
Generalized low amplitude slow waves with lack of reactivity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction in the left frontal region which has a high correlation with a lesion in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction with lack of reactivity.  Please note that this EEG is markedly changed from the previous one where there was some reactivity as well as some alpha periodicity in the frontal region.  No seizures were seen.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Myoclonus.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was unresponsive during the recording.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some sweat artifact and movement artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record has a diffusely slow background in between the bursts that I will describe in the next paragraph.  She has a markedly suppressed background with no clear electrocerebral activity.  However, this is in between much artifact which makes it difficult to make any clear final determinations about electrical activity.  In addition, she has bursts of generalized periodic epileptiform discharges with frontal predominant sharp waves and polyspikes that appear to at times increase in rhythmicity to a frequency of about 4-5 Hz and last for about 30-40 seconds.  During these bursts, which are usually symmetric, but at times slightly asymmetric, the patient appears to be clinically shaking and twitching and jerking.  These are consistent with myoclonic jerks.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  As above.
SEIZURES:  Multiple myoclonic seizures as described above.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Frequent myoclonic seizures of prolonged duration in between markedly abnormal suppressed background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cortical injury and irritability with multiple bursts of generalized periodic discharges and associated jerks consistent with myoclonic seizures.  The interictal pattern as well as the presence of myoclonus in the setting of hypoxic injury suggests a very poor prognosis.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz rhythm.  Hyperventilation produces a prominent hyperventilation response with background rhythmic theta and delta.  In addition, there is a focal hyperventilation response with occipitally predominant, sharply activity and activity that is periodic and sharply contoured in the right occipital region.  As the patient becomes drowsy, the focal slowing and sharp waves continue in the right occipital region, but then there is more of a transition to a drowsy pattern with a more rhythmic symmetric pattern.  Focal slowing and some arrhythmic delta are noted in the right occipital region.   Photic stimulation elicits little in the way of a driving response.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm, slowing to 8.5 Hz when the patient is drowsy.  Vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and POSTS are noted in stage II sleep.  During photic stimulation there are a handful of subtle sharp waves in the right central parietal region.  In addition, there are a handful of vertex waves which phase reverse primarily to the right of the midline and there are 1-2 that phase reverse to the left of the midline. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a mildly diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz and can only be seen over the left hemisphere.  Over the left hemisphere, there is normal amount of frontocentral beta, however, none can be seen over the right hemisphere.  Patient appears to be awake and go into stage change of sleep, but the classic sleep architecture is not seen. Activating procedures were not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow sharp waves seen periodically in the right hemisphere usually maximal at F8/T4, however, at times more maximal at F8, at times even more maximal at T6 and some of them appear to be maximal at FP2.  These sharp waves were occurring periodically at a frequency of 0.5-1 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts.  The periodicity is consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs).

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a pattern with generous beta.  There are bursts of relatively symmetric theta.  Superimposed on this there is a subtle asymmetry which at times drops out of faster frequency activity on the left.  The record intermittently attenuates and that attenuation may be symmetric.  In the context of a breach rhythm on the left, there are some small discrete left frontotemporal sharp waves.

An intermittent asymmetry with occasional attenuation on the left.
Occasional to rare lower amplitude discrete left frontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is most supportive of an anesthetic pattern for this patient on a propofol drip.  The generous beta may represent the medications
utilized and the brief attenuations can be part of the acute brain process or the medications.  Focal and epileptiform features in this record are quite subtle.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation is not performed, but photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized from the left hemisphere.  The right hemisphere intermittently demonstrates significant disruption of faster frequency activity, sharply contoured delta in the right hemisphere and/or spikes or sharp waves in the right hemisphere typically maximum in the temporal regions with variability including T4 and T6.  The vast majority of sharp waves are maximum at T4.  A handful appear a little bit more discreetly at C4 and there is some variability in the sharp waves.  The sharp waves are at times complex starting at F8 and then ending a bit more mid to posterotemporally.  They persist into stage 2 sleep.  As the patient waxes in and out of sleep, some of the sharp waves are right frontal.   Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.  At the close of the record, the patient has some periodic slowing in the right hemisphere.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Slowing in the left hemisphere.
A remarkably vigorous epileptiform focus in the right hemisphere with variable maximum including T4, FT2/4 and even posterotemporal.

In addition, focal sharp waves are seen infrequently at T3, mainly in sleep.
EVENTS:  At 1:24 in the morning, the patient had an event.  In the video it appears that the patient suddenly becomes agitated and wants to go home.  He stands up abruptly from the bed and starts attacking the nurses and appears to want to stand up and leave.  He stands up out of the bed and disappears from the video.  Minutes later he comes back and he is restrained.  He remains agitated and moves around the bed during the rest of the recording.  During the time the patient becomes agitated and minutes prior becoming agitated, the EEG remains normal with no epileptiform discharges or seizures seen.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a mildly diffuse slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches a frequency of 8 Hz, which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen in the left mid-temporal region at T3 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 50 microvolts seen occasionally.
In addition, focal sharp waves are seen infrequently at T3, mainly in sleep.
EVENTS:  At 1:24 in the morning, the patient had an event.  In the video it appears that the patient suddenly becomes agitated and wants to go home.  He stands up abruptly from the bed and starts attacking the nurses and appears to want to stand up and leave.  He stands up out of the bed and disappears from the video.  Minutes later he comes back and he is restrained.  He remains agitated and moves around the bed during the rest of the recording.  During the time the patient becomes agitated and minutes prior becoming agitated, the EEG remains normal with no epileptiform discharges or seizures seen.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left temporal slowing and sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy, with seizures likely arising from the left temporal region.  In addition, the episode captured agitation but did not reveal any epileptic discharges and is likely a nonepileptic event.  No seizures were captured during this day 1 of EEG monitoring.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  No activating procedures were performed, although stimulation was performed to the patient.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There are small bursts of beta that occur intermittently but appear to be fairly symmetric throughout the recording.  During the recording the patient is stimulated, and there is increasing faster frequency and muscle reactivity.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is quite agitated.  There is an extraordinary amount of muscle artifact.  She receives Versed during the EEG with little benefit.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Underneath the muscle and movement artifact, there seems to be a theta frequency background.  Surprisingly, despite the artifacts, there is a periodic complex in the left hemisphere maximum at T1, but with involvement of F7 and T3.  It overall has a generous field of spread throughout the temporal region on the left and the frontal regions.  The periodic complex is seen in approximately every 2 seconds.  It does not evolve.

MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is the patient's fourth EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized.  There is some bursts of posterior predominant slowing.  There are also bursts of frontally predominant high amplitude 3 Hz spike and slow wave activity.  This activity demonstrates some asymmetry, maybe a little bit more prominent in the right frontal region on the left.  It starts to transition to more of a 4-5 Hz spike and wave activity.
Although it is present in relaxed wakefulness, it also occurs during hyperventilation.  Most bursts are less than 2 seconds in duration.  No impairment of awareness is noted with the bursts.
As the patient becomes drowsy, following hyperventilation, the bursts are again seen, but are a little bit slower and transition to a more of an almost 3 second burst with a high amplitude frontal spike, followed by rhythmic delta, which may or may not have a spike.  All of the activity has bilateral representation, but some has a field more prominent on the right.
Photic stimulation may well have accentuated this activity and, again, in photic stimulation sometimes there did seem to be a more clearly defined right frontal spike and slow wave complex before the left, but not always.
At the end of the record when the patient is maximally awake, there is little in the way of background slowing.
Even when the EEG is well organized, the alpha rhythm remains low at 8 Hz.
HR:    64 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Frontally predominant 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity, which was accentuated by hyperventilation and photic.
Occasional shifting asymmetries, particularly in the posterior region.
A slow alpha for an adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are features in this EEG which support a focal mechanism for epilepsy.  Other features support a generalized mechanism, particularly with 3-5 Hz frontally predominant spike and wave activity, which was accentuated by hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  This suggests more than one possible contributor to this patient's epilepsy.
Of note, some of these findings were seen in an EEG in March 2011, but not in October 2010 or September 2011.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  From the beginning of the recording until approximately 02:46:30 p.m. EEG consists of diffuse multiple artifact. This makes evaluation of the underlying EEG activity unreliable.
At approximately 02:46:20 p.m., 10 mg of vecuronium is administered.  EEG artifact subsequently disappears within about 10-20 seconds.  Subsequent record demonstrates low-to-moderate amplitude theta and delta activity with posterior under-riding frequencies, without posterior dominant rhythm or anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  No abnormal sleep architecture is present.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation was not performed.  Sinus tachycardia is captured on the single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Mild diffuse slowing.
Disorganization.
Symmetry.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  The patient has a previous craniotomy on the left.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage, frontocentral beta.  A prominent breach rhythm is identified in the left frontocentral region.  Subtle, underlying focal slowing is noted.  There are also bursts of somewhat higher amplitude slowing noted in the left frontocentral region.  As the patient becomes somewhat drowsy, there is a bit of shifting slowing, some of which includes T3 and T5.  The underlying slowing may be subtle or may include a bit more arrhythmic delta, which may be frontal or occasionally mid to posterior temporal. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. Hyperventilation accentuates the bursts of focal slowing from the left.  During hyperventilation, there is some head rocking or electrode artifact noted, a bit more on the left.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing noted in the left hemisphere with 2 types of focal slowing, the first being underlying subtle slowing and the second being more well-defined arrhythmic delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A breach rhythm is an anticipated finding following craniotomy.  There is some sharply contoured activity on the left in the region of the breach, but there are no definitive sharp waves.  This EEG is similar to many previous EEGs dating to 2002, but of note, in more recent years left mid-temporal sharp waves have not been identified.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens with the patient in sleep, mainly in Stage II with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or normal frontocentral beta seen.  In between the recording the patient develops paroxysm bursts of fast activity which appears to be diffusely seen and mixed with myogenic artifact. It is difficult to piece out the electric serial activity from the myogenic artifact, but clearly occurs paroxysmally in bursts lasting up to 20 to 21 seconds.  During this event there is no clear changes that can be seen on the EEG and in the latter halves of the bursts there appears to be some rhythmic theta-like activity.

The above described episodes of generalized polyspike and fast followed intermixed with myogenic artifact and followed by some frontal theta consistent with generalized seizures.  However, clinically there are no clear behavioral changes seen on the video.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized seizures.
Polyspike discharges.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of generalized epilepsy with multiple seizures seen during the recording.  No normal awake activity was seen, but mainly the patient was recorded with intermittent sleep.  It is suggested to have continued recording of this individual as the seizures are treated]

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were performed including hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some T3 and T4 electrode artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reach 7-8 Hz which appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta seen.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation produces some accentuation of the focal slowing, which I will mention below.  Photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slowing seen intermittently at F7/T3 and at times at F8/T4 (slightly more on the left than the right) at a frequency 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Generalized slowing at 5-7 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen almost continuously throughout the recording.
SLEEP:  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild generalized slowing.
Independent bilateral anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal regions, in addition to mild generalized slowing in addition to mild generalized cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.

MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, lisinopril, lovastatin, metformin, ranitidine, Advair, Lantus.
INTRODUCTION:  Condition of the recording:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm reaches 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep symmetrical vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured.  Intermittent bursts of polymorphic theta and delta activity are captured over the right temporal region.  Intermittently this slowing is rhythmic in the delta range (TIRDA; temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity).  No clear epileptiform discharges are captured.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in occipital driving that is better pronounced over the left.
FINDINGS:
Intermittent mild to moderate left temporal slowing.
TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 22 minute awake and asleep EEG due to intermittent mild to moderate right temporal slowing that is often rhythmic.  This finding indicates focal right temporal dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  Finding of rhythmic activity over the right temporal region may indicate potential epileptogenic focus over that region.  No clear epileptiform discharges are captured.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not exclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake and drowsy.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a background that at best reaches a posterior dominant of 9 Hz.  However, the overall background appears to be intermixed with frontal maximal delta discharges that appear to reach all the way to the occipital region and seen intermittently and rhythmically.  In addition, at times there is less faster frequencies seen over the right hemisphere than the left in the frontal regions.  There is no normal sleep architecture.
Activating procedures, including hyperventilation, accentuates the frontal slowing which I will describe later.  Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal slow waves seen in the prefrontal regions, mainly FP1 and PF2, almost continuously throughout the recording at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
At times there is also frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity seen in bursts, also noted FIRDA.
There is also some left frontal temporal slowing at F7/T3 seen intermittently at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to continuous prefrontal slowing, as well as some left frontal temporal slowing.  In addition, there is some intermittent frontal FIRDA activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the prefrontal regions, in addition to the left frontal temporal or anterior temporal regions, which may be related to known previous trauma.  In addition, there is evidence of frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity which is nonspecific in regards to etiology, but may be due at least in part to medication effect or metabolic encephalopathy, although these findings can be very nonspecific.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen which is different to the previous EEG which had noted some left anterior temporal or left temporal sharp waves.

HISTORY:  This is a 59-year-old right-handed woman with past medical history significant for dementia and asthma, who presents for worsening of forgetfulness and agitation.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the lab using the standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  These tracing captures wakefulness through short period of drowsiness.  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 9 to 9.5 hertz in frequency, 30-40 microvolts in amplitude, seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye-blink artifacts.  There are intermittent periods of bitemporal slowing at F7/T3 and F8/T4 during wakefulness and short period of drowsiness consisting of 3 hertz delta frequency, 50-60 microvolt in amplitude lasting 1-2 seconds.  Hyperventilation resulted in slowing seen in most cerebral hemispheres.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple fresh frequencies and resulting in a driving response.  Heart rate was 70-80 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to bitemporal slowing during wakefulness and short period of drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings are suggestive of bilateral structural abnormalities or bilateral cerebral dysfunction.  Other causes included toxic metabolic or infectious encephalopathy, or degenerative causes.  There were no epileptiform abnormalities or seizures noted during this study.  The abscess of epileptiform abnormalities does not exclude to possibility of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.  If seizure remains a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing either stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG monitoring may be helpful.

This pattern is consistent with an electrographic seizure.  The electrographic seizure continues without stopping until about almost 19 minutes later after receiving Ativan at 1:39 p.m.  After that the EEG appears to go back to a diffusely slow background with some prefrontal slowing.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to an electrographic prefrontal maximal seizure with no clear onset seen as well as bifrontal slowing and generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals electrographic seizures which appears to be maximally in the frontal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the frontal region as well as diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology, but is likely related to the hypoxic injury.  These findings were discussed with the team and the patient will be placed on long-term monitoring.

MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Ativan, atenolol, nifedipine, Bactrim, insulin, pravastatin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake and lethargic.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact seen at times.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  The patient was recorded mainly while drowsy.  There is some sleep architecture that can be seen.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Overall the background consists of delta frequency, slowing seen diffusely with some variability up on stimulation.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen frequently at 01 and at times at T5/P3.  Frequently throughout the recording at times the sharp waves become rhythmic and occurred at a frequency of 1-2 Hz and then they start and stop.
Focal slowing seen in the posterior quadrant in the area of 01/T5/P3.  This slowing at times is rhythmic but does not  clearly evolve or appear to be epileptic.
Diffuse slowing seen at a frequency of 2-4 Hz, amplitude 20-60 microvolts.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This was a technically challenging EEG due to the patient's matted hair and encrusted blood.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a markedly slow pattern with slow delta and some faster frequency activity.  The patient is somewhat interactive despite the background slowing and the technologist reports that with stimulation the patient will move the right hand to command.
There is a small amount of faster frequency activity noted in the frontal regions, as well as slow frontal delta.
Heart rate:  120 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a technically challenging, but markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing.
Shifting slowing with a bit more rhythmic delta noted with stimulation on the left compared to the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  On the whole this EEG supports a severe bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function with shifting asymmetries, but no specific lateralization.  Although the patient appeared to be responsive to the family, the responsive was difficult to identify.  No epileptiform features were identified.  Given the number of sedative hypnotic medications utilized, medications may play a significant role in the pattern described above.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in ICU using the standard international 10/20 system of electrode placement in addition to two T1-T2 electrodes and 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This tracing captures the patient in a comatose state, sedated state.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the comatose/sedated state, there was seen diffuse attenuation of the background with intermittent EKG artifacts.  There was unknown artifact in bilateral frontoparietal regions likely due to a ventilators.  There was seen very low voltage 1.5 Hz delta frequency activity and occasional 3 Hz delta frequency activity of 5-10 microvolt amplitude.  There was seen no spontaneous variability and reactivity on stimulating the patient.  No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen during this recording.  Heart rate was 80-90 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing the patient in a comatose/sedative state due to diffuse slowing and attenuation of the background.  No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen during this recording.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Diffuse slowing and attenuation of the background are suggestive of severe anoxic encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to severe metabolic or infectious encephalopathy or due to effect of medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction.  In addition, diffuse attenuation could be seen in bilateral fluid collection in the extra-axial space or the overlying skull.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or of intermittent seizures.  If clinically indicated, a continuous bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly slow with diffuse delta noted.  There is a breach rhythm on the left with higher amplitude, sharply contoured delta with a broad field of spread at T3.  There is also electrode pop and irregular delta or focal delta in the right posterior region, T6-L2, and sometimes C4.  As the patient drifts off to sleep there is a small increase in beta.  There are also a handful of more triangular shaped higher amplitude right frontal delta waves.
Photic stimulation is remarkable for photoelectric artifact, but no significant driving.

MEDICATIONS:  Include Keppra, insulin, Lopressor, Coumadin, Synthroid, etc.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of nearly continuous frequent high amplitude diffuse EMG artifact that corresponds to teeth grinding.  During brief periods of EEG that do not contain this artifact, the background appears to consist of diffuse polymorphic theta and delta activity.  Multiple electrodes have high impedances due to poor patient cooperation with the exam.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  No normal sleep architecture is observed.  Heart rate of approximately 120 beats a minute is observed on a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Nearly continuous teeth grinding artifact.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake only 22-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing. This finding indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction. However, the majority of the recording was obscured by frequent teeth grinding artifact, and epileptiform discharges could have been missed.  If clinically indicated, a repeat study with less artifact may be of benefit.  Tachycardia is noted on the single EKG lead.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a slow, mixed frequency pattern with theta and delta.  There are frontally predominant triphasic waves.  There are also some slow periodic complexes that appear in the right posterior quadrant more so than the left.  Stimulation of the patient produces a clear alerting response with a bit more fast theta frequency activity and a suggestion of a 6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.

The patient has limited motor deficits, but significant aphasia.  The clinical team noted that the patient speaks occasionally but never on rounds.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, aspirin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not possible due to the patient's mental status, but photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates continuous focal slowing from the left hemisphere, some of which is sharply contoured with a phase reversal at T1.  There are T1 sharp waves noted intermittently.  The field of focal slowing is relatively diffuse throughout the left hemisphere, and there is disruption of the alpha rhythm.  In wakefulness, the right hemisphere demonstrates a well-formed alpha rhythm.
Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing.  Early stage I sleep was identified with limited vertex waves.  Of note, as the patient transitions to sleep, there is less in the way of rhythmic sharply contoured slowing.  Photic stimulation produces a driving response on the right but not the left.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to prominent, rhythmic slowing with sharp waves, really seen primarily in wakefulness on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were no clear clinical correlates for the features described above.  There are brief transitions into stage II sleep for this individual, although sleep was not sustained, but the majority of the sharply contoured slowing and rhythmic slowing is seen in wakefulness.  Ongoing monitoring is essential.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best wakefulness reaches 6 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is no normal frontocentral beta.  Overall the patient is mainly recorded during sleep but during the limited wakefulness appears to be extensive theta.  No activating procedures were performed and clear staged changes were seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen at T4 intermittently at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen during wakefulness and at times with frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).
SEIZURES:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to a right mid temporal focal slowing as well as generalized slowing of frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right mid temporal region, which is consistent with a known hemorrhage.  In addition, there is evidence of moderate to diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology and may be due at least in part to medication effect.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was an awake and drowsy record with photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the EEG is reasonably well organized with a 10 Hertz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low-voltage, frontocentral beta.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab  using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage, frontal central beta activity.  Although there is a great deal of eye movement artifact, in hyperventilation and relaxed wakefulness, there is very subtle underlying focal slowing in the right mid temporal region at T1, T2, T4.  Unfortunately, this is challenging to distinguish from the patient's nearly continuous eye blinks in wakefulness.  Features of drowsiness included an increase in theta beta which is relatively symmetric.  In drowsiness, there is some wicket as the patient transitions to stage I sleep with vertex waves and then spindles.
Photic stimulation elicited subtle driving.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This was a challenging EEG due to the patient's persistent movement.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a very low voltage and slow pattern.  The patient has constant mouth movements.  Despite this, there is some underlying, slow periodic sharply contoured delta from the left hemisphere and potentially some from the right.
Stimulation of the patient produces muscle artifact.  During some sections of the record the patient is awake and talking with a markedly slow background.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is in awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8.3 Hz alpha rhythm.  Central mu-activity was noted, the mu-activity was 9 Hz, but testing was not performed to confirm this.
Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements, anterior spread of the alpha rhythm, and increase in beta followed by theta with rare vertex waves.  The patient was transitioned into stage 2 sleep with vertex waves and spindles during photic stimulation.  Despite this, a driving response was elicited.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep due to
Slight slowing of the alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  The mild slowing of the alpha rhythm is a nonspecific finding.  It may be a part of postictal state or other diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study may be of value.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Previously EEG's were not available for comparison.  Photic stimulation was completed, but hyperventilation was not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is awake.  She had significant oral dyskinesia and there is muscle activity that persists even if she becomes drowsy.  In the waking recording, there is primarily a theta frequency pattern.  As she transitions into stage I sleep, vertex waves were seen.  There is a subtle, discrete, underlying low amplitude spike in the left frontocentral region which can be differentiated from artifact.  There may be one as well on the right (region not as well defined) and on one occasion the spike is followed by a vertex wave.  Bursts of arrhythmic, frontally predominant delta are noted as the patient transitions to deeper stages of sleep.  There is also some Firda in that transition to sleep.
Photic stimulation produces a great deal of muscle and photoelectric artifact, right greater than left, but there is driving at 15 Hz.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging, but abnormal EEG due to:
Significant background slowing.
Disorganization.
Discrete, low voltage frontocentral sharps.
There was a previous EEG from 08/28/2012 demonstrating frequent left hemispheric maximal anterior slowing.  This EEG is essentially congruent with that pattern; although, today's EEG is significantly slower.  The low voltage spikes are also ipsilateral to the left.  In that this EEG today is significantly slower than the previous study, correlation with clinical history is important as medications, metabolic disorders, or progression of her dementia may all contribute to the pattern identified above.

He returned from operating room this morning with seizure activity, treated with Ativan.  There is no T1 and T2 electrodes due to skull defect.
MEDICATIONS:  Fentanyl, midazolam, morphine, Ativan, Keppra, and Zofran.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  There is no T1 and T2 electrodes due to his skull defect.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In the sedated state, there is diffuse slowing of the background consisting of delta activity, 2-3 Hz frequency, most pronounced on the left side.  There is intermittent alpha activity with a frequency of 8-9 Hz, lasting for 1-2 seconds, most pronounced in frontotemporal region.  There is hemispheric asymmetry characterized by higher amplitude in left hemispheric regions, most pronounced in the frontotemporal areas.  There is slowing of the background activity in delta range with a frequency of 2-3 Hz almost continuously.  There is spontaneous variability seen with increase in background frequency.  There is also reactivity to stimulation.  There is no epileptiform activity or clinical seizures noted during this recording.  Heart rate was 100 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Diffuse slowing of the background activity in delta and theta range intermixed with intermittent alpha activity.
Focal slowing and breach in left cerebral hemisphere, most pronounced in frontotemporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings are suggestive of metabolic, toxic, hypoxic, or infectious encephalopathy or due to the effect of sedating medications.  Left focal slowing is indicative of focal structural dysfunction in the left cerebral hemisphere, most pronounced in frontotemporal region.  Breach rhythm is consistent with a history of left craniectomy.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or of intermittent seizures.

The patient developed post traumatic epilepsy and has had recent seizures.  His highest seizure frequency has been as high as 10 seizures per day.
MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed on this patient using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG monitoring.  During the course of the recording hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  The recording captures wakefulness through stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.
Recording was 22minutes in duration.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the record opens there is a symmetric 8.5 to 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm that is reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of frontocentral beta activity that is present as well.  Drowsiness is characterized by a decrease in eye blinks and the appearance of slowing in the theta range in the occipital electrodes.  There is the appearance of slow rolling eye movements.  Throughout the recording there is intermittent focal slowing noted over the right hemisphere.  This is most prominent over the right frontotemporal region, but also extends into the frontocentral regions.  On several occasions throughout the recording there are medium amplitude sharp waves identified that are maximal in the right frontal region phase reversing at F8 and T4.  These occur as isolated sharp waves.  Hyperventilation induces generalized slowing in the tracing.  Photic stimulation does not induce a significant photic driving response.  There were no clinical events recorded or noted by the technician during the recording epoch.  There were no electrographic seizures identified. Heart rate varied from 60-80.
IMPRESSION:  In summary, this is an abnormal EEG capturing wakefulness through stage 2 sleep due to the presence of focal slowing over the right hemisphere and rare sharp waves noted over the right frontotemporal region.  The appearance of focal slowing may be suggestive of a structural brain lesion in this region.  Sharp waves have epileptiform potential.

MEDICATIONS:
RECORDING TIMES:  The record starts at 10:29 a.m. It ends at 10:53 a.m.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This is a bedside EEG recording.  As the record opens, there is a low voltage 10 to 11 Hz posterior dominant rhythm that is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There is a small to moderate amount of central theta activity that persists throughout the recording and is suggestive of background slowing.  Throughout the recording, there is a repetitive rhythmic eye blink eye movement abnormality noted in __________ that obscures much of the recording in that region.
At 10:43 a.m., the patient was noticed clinically to become agitated but there was no associated change in the background cerebral activity.
Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and did not induce a significant photic driving response.  There were no spikes or sharp waves identified.  There were no electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of diffuse bihemispheric mild slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Bihemispheric slowing may be seen in toxic metabolic encephalopathies or in diffuse underlying structural brain injury.  A single episode of agitation was not associated with any change in the background cerebellar EEG.

INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement with the addition of anterior temporal single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software in addition to nurse's notes were used to review the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm and frontocentral beta.  Overall, there are theta delta mixed frequencies intermingled with multiple multifocal spikes which I will describe in Abnormal Discharges.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Multifocal spikes seen at O1, O2, T6, Fp1, Fp2, T3, and P4.  However, the spikes are mainly seen at O1 and O2 and Fp1/Fp2.
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen almost continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  During the record, there are multiple seizures which in the EEG appear to begin suddenly and display rhythmic, sharply contoured theta intermixed with beta that at times appears to be maximal frontally and then centrally with an overlying rhythmic occipital sharp focus.  The maximal focus or origin of the seizure is unclear.  It is also atypical as it does not appear to evolve as it suddenly starts, remains in the EEG at almost this irregular but continuous frequency, and then appears to slowly dissipate.  During these discharges, the patient appears to move her head side to side and sometimes moves her arms in a wild fashion.  On 1 occasion, her mouth appeared to twitch in the video.  The duration of these episodes can be anywhere from 1 or 2 minutes to prolonged 38-minute seizure.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to multiple seizures with unclear origin and multifocal spikes.

MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is awake.  The background is diffusely slow with a mixture of theta and smaller amounts of delta.  Occasional, right or left anterior temporal spikes were noted in the background.  There are independent, right or left temporal sharp waves and spikes noted in wakefulness.  There are more noted on the right in comparison to the left.  In addition, the epileptiform activity is at times complex with an extensive field of spread or some variability in terms of maximum at T2 and/or spread to the frontal regions.  As the patient became a bit drowsy, epileptiform activity with the field of spread which included posterotemporal regions and even a polyspike component was noted.  During photic stimulation, there are independent sharp waves or spikes noted.  In addition, during the 3 Hz stimulation, there is a run of rhythmic 4 Hz activity, but without frequency evolution.  Similar activity was not seen on the left.
Heart rate 96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Complex epileptiform activity with independent sharp waves or spikes noted from either hemisphere typically with a temporal maximum, T1 or T2, but sometimes with a polyspike component or spread to the frontal regions or occipital regions.
An unusual discharge during the 3 Hz stimulation which may have represented a subclinical seizure.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  The epileptiform activity is more complex than is typically seen in garden variety temporal lobe epilepsy.  There is a polyspike component and a generous field of spread.  In this particular EEG, there is more epileptiform activity on the right.

MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with additional single-lead EKG electrode.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 9-10 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Stage 1 sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  There are almost continuous left temporal slowing at F7/T3 during wakefulness and sleep, consisting of 2-3 Hz delta frequency.  There are also focal slow waves seen independently in the bilateral frontal regions almost continuously throughout the recording at 3-4 Hz.  Hyperventilation results in accentuation of slowing, most pronounced on the left side.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and resulted in a driving response.  Heart rate was 70 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to bifrontal slowing and left temporal slowing.  No epileptiform activities or seizures are identified in this recording.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient seems to be drowsy throughout much of the EEG, but in wakefulness there is excess beta and excess theta in a somewhat poorly organized record.  In the sharply contoured background, there is prominent frontal beta and as the patient becomes drowsy there is some paroxysmal high amplitude bursts, but no definitive frontal sharp waves or spikes.
Hyperventilation seems to accentuate the background slowing and there is a very subtle focality with perhaps a bit more left-sided focal slowing in hyperventilation compared to the right.
Photic stimulation is remarkable for generous beta, but a driving response.  Heart rate is 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG in wakefulness and sleep due to:
Somewhat disorganized pattern for age.
Excess beta.
Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The excess beta could be due to medication effect or anxiety.  The excess theta suggests a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  It is important to have a complete list of this patient's medications.  No definitive sharp waves or spikes were seen.  A more prolonged study capturing sleep may be of value.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a pattern with diffuse beta and bursts of spindles.  In addition, there is arrhythmic delta activity and the beta drops out for a burst of arrhythmic delta activity.  The arrhythmic delta activity is somewhat more remarkable on the right, and there is subtle underlying sharply contoured slowing in the right posterior occipital region as well as a bit more attenuation of faster frequency activity on the right relative to the left.  Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in rhythmic theta.  As the recording continues, the background EEG is richer in both beta and theta.  The initial asymmetry is a bit less prominent.
Heart rate 72 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a dynamic but abnormal EEG due to:
Initial markedly slow pattern with intermittent paroxysmal beta.
At the end of the record, the EEG remains quite slow, but there is an increase in beta and a decrease in the arrhythmic delta activity.
An asymmetry with a bit more arrhythmic delta activity in the right posterior quadrant.
Some sharply contoured slowing in the right posterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The postictal state and the use of sedative hypnotic medications may play a role in the marked background slowing and the beta in this record.  No seizures were recorded.  The arrhythmic delta activity may be correlated with imaging.  If seizures are an important consideration, a repeat tracing is suggested, given the sharply contoured slowing described above.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Morphine, Zofran, and Percocet.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was noted to have a prominent right craniotomy.
TECHNICAL:  There is some muscle artifact, but overall this is a technically satisfactory record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the EEG is remarkable for a mixture of arrhythmic mixed theta-delta from the right hemisphere.  The left hemisphere has more of a medium amplitude more rhythmic theta pattern.  Although the patient is awake and following commands, an alpha rhythm was not identified.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, more of a rhythmic theta pattern is noted on the left with a mixture of arrhythmic delta and theta on the right.  Asymmetric spindles were noted out of the right central region.  In the context of a breech rhythm, there is some very subtle right frontocentral sharp waves noted.
The patient transitions in and out of stage II sleep with spindle activity.
Heart rate 50 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Continuous focal slowing on the right.
Background slowing on the left.
Rare discrete right frontal sharp waves.
FIRDA noted at the close of the record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural process on the right.  There are some subtle sharp waves noted in the region of the craniotomy on the right.  The bilateral background slowing suggests a bihemispheric process and may be part of this patient's postoperative pattern.  Correlation with imaging and clinical history is suggested.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 19-year-old woman with a history of seizures since the age of 2, now presents with concern for status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include:  Lamictal and 8 mg of Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Condition of the recording:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of diffuse rhythmic and semi-rhythmic high amplitude frontally predominant delta activity mixed with bursts of diffuse spindle-like wave forms.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.  At least 3 electrographic seizures are noted. These seizures start with approximately a 10-12 second run of fast activity most pronounced over the right occipital lead.  This activity eventually spread to the right anterior region. During this spread, rhythmic more frequency theta and delta activity are captured over the right anterior leads with some reflection over the left hemisphere.  Seizure offset is gradual.  Total seizure duration is approximately one minute.  Increase in heart rate up to 150 to 180 beats a minutes is noted during seizure.  During one of the seizures, the patient bites on the ET tube.
A single EKG lead demonstrates continued tachycardia with heart rate on average of approximately 120 beats a minute.
FINDINGS:
At least 3 electrographic seizures with right occipital onset lasting approximately 1 minute.
Runs of bilateral posterior fast activity.
Moderate to severe diffuse slowing.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal electroencephalogram due to moderate diffuse slowing, intermittent high frequency activity observed posteriorly, as well as 3 focal right hemisphere electrographic seizures with onset of right occipital leads.  Diffuse slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific cerebral dysfunction, that in this case could partially be related to medications.  There is a seizure onset focus that is suspected to be over the right occipital region.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 19-year-old woman with a history of seizures who now presents with recurrent complex partial seizures and a change in behavior, subsequently found to have status epilepticus.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Versed, phenobarbital.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
The recording was reviewed on several occasions during the 24 hour recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency gradient.  The background consists mostly of a mixture of low amplitude delta activity with underwriting faster frequencies and 1 to 4 second diffuse bursts of spindle-like waveforms.  No clear normal architecture is captured.  Multiple electrographic seizures of variable duration are noted throughout the recording.  Seizure duration varies from 30 seconds to over 30 minutes.  Seizure onset is often poorly localized.  Some start with bilateral central frontal fast activity that increases in amplitude and decreases in frequency to the alpha range.  More prolonged seizures start with diffuse frontally predominant delta activity with underwriting by frontocentral faster activity.  This activity increases in amplitude and decreases in frequency, and spreads throughout other cerebral regions.  During multiple long seizures the seizure output is not clear.  There has been some tachycardia noted on a electrocardiogram lead.  During seizures heart rate increases to approximately 120 beats per minute.
FINDINGS:
Intermittent electrographic seizures with poor localization and lateralization with variable durations from 30 seconds to approximately 30 minutes.
Moderate to severe diffuse slowing and low amplitude attenuation.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 24 hour EEG due to intermittent seizures and frank status epilepticus as well as moderate to severe diffuse slowing.  The slowing indicates etiological nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction, and in this case likely related to medication effect.  These findings were conveyed to the Primary Team.

MEDICATIONS:  Current medications:  Keppra, clonidine, Plavix, amlodipine.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording is performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Step photic stimulation was performed.  The recording was performed in the laboratory.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with faster waveforms at higher amplitudes over the right hemisphere.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the right consists of moderate amplitude well-formed and modulated 10Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient over the right as well.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the left reaches approximately 9 to 9.5 Hz alpha activity.  There is an AP gradient over the left hemisphere with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Additional polymorphic theta activity is present over the left hemisphere, most pronounced over the left temporal region.  During drowsiness the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and bursts of theta are captured.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Photic stimulation does not result in additional abnormalities.  A regular cardiac rhythm is noted on the single EKG lead.  There is diffuse excess beta throughout the recording.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Continuous mild left hemispheric slowing, most pronounced over the left temporal region.
Excess beta.
No stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 21-minute EEG due to mild continuous left hemispheric slowing, most pronounced over the left temporal region.  This findings indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, and in this patient is consistent with a history of left middle cerebral artery territory stroke.  Excess beta could be secondary to the medication effect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persists a repeat study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  A prominent craniotomy defect was noted in the left temporal and central regions.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a well formed, __________ rhythm reaching 70 microvolts in amplitude.  A prominent breech rhythm was noted with accentuation of beta activity in the left temporal and central regions almost involving the right central region.  Intermittent underlying focal slowing was noted in the left central temporal region and was clearly accentuated by hyperventilation.  In addition, there was some shifting and slowing also accentuated by hyperventilation.  In this sharply contoured record, as the patient transitions in and out of stage I and stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles, there are a handful of sharp waves noted in the left central temporal region with an after going slow wave.  Other features of the drowsy record include an accentuation of the focal slowing in the left hemisphere including frontocentral and posterior temporal regions with attenuation of activity in drowsiness in the left frontocentral region.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting off into stage II sleep.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate:  60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Left hemispheric focal slowing with variable maxima depending on whether the patient is awake, asleep or performing hyperventilation.
In the context of a breech rhythm and a sharply contoured record, there are a handful of sharp waves with after going slow waves in the left mid temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The findings described above are congruent with a structural process on the left as well as a breech rhythm.  A breech rhythm can accentuate background activity but there are a handful of sharp waves with after going slow waves suggesting an ongoing potential for seizures in this seizure free adult.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Continuous muscle artifact throughout the temporalis and central region of the head.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is an absence of normal brain activity and there is an overlying muscle artifact throughout the recording.  There appears to be no variability or reactivity to the EEG and overall there is a low amplitude slowing seen throughout the recording.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slowing at 1-3 Hz and an amplitude of less than 10 microvolts seen continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  114, irregular.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to marked to severe generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of marked generalized cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.

MEDICATIONS:  Current medications Keppra, loaded with Dilantin, phenobarbital, and placed on Versed drip later in the recording.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording is performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1-T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  CT compatible electrodes were used.  The recording was reviewed intermittently throughout the 24 hour period by an  attending neurologist.  Medical staff notes and nursing staff notes were reviewed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with lower waveforms and high amplitudes over the left hemisphere.  The background over the right hemisphere has a posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 8-9 Hz activity with weak anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  There is additional polymorphic theta activity observed over the right hemisphere.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the left hemisphere consists of approximately 8 Hz theta activity without clear anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background over the left hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity.  Throughout the recording additional diffuse low amplitude rhythmic slow delta activity is captured.  As the recording progresses, frequency of this delta activity becomes more pronounced.  Additionally as the recording progresses the patient appears to start having poorly formed electrographic seizures emanating from the left temporal parietal region.  These seizures are characterized by rhythmic theta activity most pronounced over the left lateral leads.  As the recording progresses seizures appear to spread diffusely and are characterized by diffuse rhythmic delta activity, with associated blink artifact.  Clinically the patient appears to have a rhythmic bilateral eye blinking.  Ativan was administered but did not result in cessation of status epilepticus.  The patient was subsequently loaded with IV Dilantin.  This resulted in resolution of generalized status epilepticus; however, he continued to have focal left temporal parietal status epilepticus.  The patient was subsequently intubated at 11:52 p.m. using propofol.  This resulted in abrupt discontinuation of status epilepticus as well as diffuse burst suppression.  That lasted several minutes.  As burst suppression decreased discrete moderate amplitude sharp waves were observed over the left temporoparietal region.  Their frequency gradually increased to approximately 1 Hz.  These discharges constituted PLEDs.  These discharges are accompanied by lower amplitude fast activity thus representing PLEDs-plus.  Occasionally frequency of these discharges increases but never lasts longer than 10 seconds.  This constitutes a brief ictal rhythmic discharges (BIRDS).
FINDINGS:  Left temporal parietal seizures that slowly evolved into generalized status epilepticus.  PLEDs and PLEDs-plus emanating from the left temporal parietal region observed after 12 a.m..  Diffuse background slowing and discontinuation.  Focal left hemispheric slowing.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 24-hour continuous audio video electroencephalogram  monitoring due to gradual resolution of focal left temporal parietal status epilepticus that evolves into generalized status epilepticus.  __________ status epilepticus resolves with administration of Ativan and Dilantin.  However, focal left temporal parietal status epilepticus persists.  It resolves with administration of anesthetic  agent and initiation of phenobarbital.  However, periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges are still observed at that time.  Diffuse background slowing indicates __________ nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal left hemispheric slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural etiology and in this patient is partially related to postictal phenomenon.  These findings were conveyed to the Neurology primary team.

He also has a history of drug and ethanol abuse.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This tracing captures the patient in a vague and lethargic state.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 8.5-9 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening, well formed on the left side.  There is moderate amount of frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness and stage 2 sleep are characterized by slowing of the background, slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifacts, and presence of posts and vertex sharp waves.  Continuous focal slowing of continuous focal slow waves seen at F8/T4 at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 30-60 microvolts.  Sharp waves are seen with shifting negativity at FP1/FP2/F4, which occur frequently during the recording.  There are periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges seen in the right hemisphere, maximum at right superior frontal and anterior temporal region occurring with a frequency of 0.5-1.5 Hz with no evolution.  There are excess of 7-7.5 Hz theta activity seen during short period of wakefulness.  Heart rate was 70 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing the patient at brief period of wakefulness and lethargic state due to:  One, diffuse slowing of the background.  Two, presence of sharp waves in FP1/FP2, and F8 and right periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges.  Three, almost continuous focal slowing of right temporal region.  There was no electrographic seizures during this recording.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the prefrontal region.  In addition, there is evidence of continued structural focal cerebral dysfunction in the right anterior temporal region, which has a high correlation with the lesion in that region consistent with patient's history of right middle cerebral artery stroke.  No electrographic seizures were seen.  Clinical correlation is recommended.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a routine EEG with satisfactory impedances aside from the T1-T2 electrode.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which is somewhat disrupted on the right compared to the left.  There are bursts of bilateral, relatively rhythmic slowing.  In addition, there is shifting slowing, more so on the right compared to the left.  Features of drowsiness include a decrease in muscle.  In addition, focal slowing from the right becomes a bit more prominent as the patient transitions in and out of drowsiness.  The focal slowing on the right is intermittent.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was relatively drowsy and did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to.
Focal slowing from the right hemisphere with disruption of faster frequency activity and intermittent disruption of the alpha rhythm.
Shifting slowing.
Occasional bursts of bilateral slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the fourth EEG for this individual.  No epileptiform features have been seen in this EEG or the two previous EEGs.  The focal slowing on the right is ipsilateral to the
patient's stroke.  Of note, the last two EEGs have shown a bit more in the way of generalized features including generalized slowing or shifting slowing.

The patient had epilepsy in recent years.  Recently hospitalized for multiple repetitive seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were noted in this section of the record, which includes wakefulness and sleep.  The patient was noted to have intermittent twitching of the right shoulder.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  Wakefulness and sleep:  In wakefulness and sleep, the background EEG includes a well-organized background with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  As the patient becomes drowsy, subtle focal slowing was noted in the right hemisphere.  This is characterized by an initial drop out of faster frequency activity on the right with a bit more slow and slightly more irregular delta.  Other features of sleep include bursts of background slowing.  There is some muscle twitch artifact noted as the patient drifts off into sleep.  Although clinically the patient has unilateral shoulder jerking, the twitch artifact is bilateral on some occasions, and on other occasions very low voltage in sleep in the right scalp electrodes.
Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Very subtly abnormal EEG in wakefulness and sleep due to:  Subtle focal slowing in the right hemisphere noted primarily in sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive epileptiform features were noted.  Some muscle twitch artifact was picked up.  Additional EEG recording will be obtained in an attempt to characterize this patient's seizures.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed. is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 40 microvolt dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Hyperventilation was early on in the record producing bursts of shifting slowing. This can be seen in the right or left As the patient became drowsy, there was an increase in background slowing noted.
In early drowsiness, there is a slight asymmetry with a bit more focal slowing noted on the left.
The patient is relatively drowsy during photic stimulation and the bursts of shifting slowing noted. During photic stimulation, there was a discrete, frontal, 5 Hz spike and wave complex This discharge has bifrontal representation but is maximum on the right. There is another, subtle fragment of a spike and wave discharge noted around the time of photic stimulation but not during it and after photic stimulation additional, 3 Hz spike and wave complexes were noted as the patient started to drift off to sleep.
HEART RATE: 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to:
1. Discrete, frontally predominant 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity.
2. Shifting slowing, sometimes a bit more prominent on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG Is similar to previous studies. Some EEGs have demonstrated discrete, generalized spike and wave activity. The fact that the 1 discharge is maximum the right is not necessarily clinically significant In comparison to other EEGs which have some background slowing and disorganization, there is less In the way of background disorganization noted In this d but there are bursts of shifting slowing, left more so than the right, raising the possibility of more than 1 mechanism No local epileptiform features were noted in this EEG.
