INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This patient and the parent report that the patient’s symptoms of staring and spacing have dramatically reduced at this time.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for an individual of this age with a 9 Hz, 70 V posterior dominant rhythm and posterior slow waves of youth.  LAMBDA activity is noted when the patient looks about the room.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increase in background theta.  Following hyperventilation, as the patient becomes drowsy, vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles are seen in stage II sleep.  Of note, even prior to hyperventilation when the patient is looking about the room, when not stimulated, she seems to become drowsy with brief vertex waves followed by an alerting.
Photic stimulation elicits symmetric driving.
HR:  70 to 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  In contrast to her previous record, no temporal wicket was identified in this record.

MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION: Sleep deprived digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9.5 Hz, 60 V posterior dominant rhythm in what appears to be posterior slow waves of youth.  The patient becomes quite drowsy and in drowsiness there are hypersynchronous bursts of rhythmic, high amplitude frontal theta and delta.  On one or two occasions, this appears to be a notch, but there is no definitive spike and slow wave activity.  Features of stage II sleep include vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces bursts of rhythmic, relatively symmetric high amplitude mixed theta and delta activity.  On one or two occasions this is notched, but again there is no definitive epileptiform activity.  Immediately following hyperventilation, as the patient becomes drowsy, there is a single right temporal sharp wave.
Photic stimulation elicits brief driving.
HR:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This EEG must be considered within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No definitive epileptiform features were identified in this record.  While there is some notched, rhythmic, frontal slowing, there is no definitive spike and slow wave activity.  In addition, with a single right temporal sharp wave, this must be considered artifactual rather than necessarily indicative of epileptiform activity.  To further characterize this patient’s symptoms, a follow-up study or more prolonged study may be of use.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standing 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was performed for only less than one minute because the patient felt uncomfortable. Photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric and well organized.  There is a 9 to 10 Hz, 50 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. The alpha rhythm was well attenuated with eye opening. MU rhythm was identified in the central area.  Hyperventilation was performed for less than one minute.  Post-hyperventilation the patient became drowsy with slow rolling eye movements and with attenuation of the background.  In drowsiness, posterior slowing of 4 to 5 Hz activity is seen.  The posterior occipital slowing has harmonic features with the alpha activity. Photic stimulation elicits driving.
HR:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform discharges were seen in this tracing.  The occipital slowing during drowsiness is an unusual pattern and a repeat EEG may be helpful in distinguishing between the occipital harmonic features versus a pathological pattern.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is a one-hour EEG.  The patient experienced some of her symptoms during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is awake, alert, and interactive.  She is observed to have tremulousness of the arms and face in wakefulness without EEG change.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record with poor effort.  This increases the patient’s trembling including facial twitching and the patient is slow to respond, however, the EEG throughout the entire hyperventilation is normal.  During this one-hour EEG, the patient again experiences the arm and face trembling at 11:02.  The tech again performs testing. The patient initially has difficulty responding, but then answers questions appropriately.  The EEG remains normal with a normal awake pattern.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric and low voltage.  There is an 8 Hz, 20 V posterior dominant rhythm and excessively diffuse beta activity.  The patient easily fell to sleep and frequent REM sleep was recorded.  The patient would wake up from REM sleep and then fall back to sleep.  POSTS activity was recognized in light sleep, and rhythmic slowing was seen in drowsiness.  Stage ___ Sleep was evidenced by a mixed frequency-----, and REM sleep was evidenced by rapid oscillatory eye movements with a low voltage background.

MEDICATIONS: Compazine, Ativan, thiamine, and Zyprexa.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient was medicated with Ativan prior to the test. The patient has modest, involuntary movements.  She has none of her severe spasms.  Stimulation of the patient in an attempt to elicit the spasms is not performed.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is rich in beta frequency activity.  In maximal weakness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz, with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  As she becomes drowsy, there is an increase in background beta activity with occasional vertex waves.  The overall background is low voltage.
Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving response at 3 Hz and faster flash frequencies.
HR:  112 BPM, with rare PVCs.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage I sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The generous beta may be due to this patient’s medications.  In that this patient’s left-sided motor activity had been thought to be epileptiform in nature, if desired, a repeat EEG with stimulation of the patient to elicit the motor would be helpful.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with an increase in background beta.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in the amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation is reviewed with the digital video EEG.  The technologist reports that the patient is getting antsy and agitated during photic stimulation, although the audio is off.  A bilateral brief driving response is seen and there is also some head-rocking artifact.  The technologist’s notes are excellent, although there is no audio.  The patient is telling the tech that the photic stimulation is making her shake.  Reviewing the EEG, there is head-rocking artifact in the background and the tech describes the patient as having a panic attack, but there is no epileptiform activity and the patient does permit the conclusion of photic stimulation, which elicits a bilateral driving response.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 30 to 50 V posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In relaxed wakefulness and early drowsiness, there is rhythmic, 5 Hz, sharply contoured activity with a flat-top shape in the left temporal region.  This may appear in bursts lasting up to 1.5 seconds.  There is a very slight degree of variability in the activity.  Identical, 5.2 Hz activity is identified from the right in similar states.

IMPRESSION: This EEG is at the limits of normal in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No definite epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The findings described above are most compatible with a psychomotor variant.  They have the characteristic 5 Hz activity.  On the left, there is just a touch of variability in terms of actual frequency, but the identical activity is seen on the right in the same sleep state.  To further define this, a repeat study in deeper stages of sleep could be of use, however, a previous study in stage II sleep earlier this year did not identify epileptiform activity.

Photic stimulation elicits minimal driving response.  The tremor artifact marches through, changing depending on the montage employed.
HR:  54 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified.   The tremor this patient experiences produces a significant amount of artifact.  Techniques to reduce this might have included the use of additional electrodes or perhaps modifying the position of the patient’s head and/or checking impedance.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a well-formed 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is intermittent rhythmic theta activity seen in wakefulness and drowsiness.  A muscle monitor is not seen, but it has a rhythmic muscle artifact, which may be part of this patient’s tremor. This artifact disappears with features of stage II sleep including vertex waves and spindles.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
A likely underlying MU rhythm is seen, but testing is not performed to confirm this.
As the recording continues, there is a question as to whether or not there is SREDA, a normal variant seen in the elderly.
HR:  __ BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Some rhythmic, normal variants are noted in the record including a MU rhythm and likely SREDA.

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 12Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Symmetric vertex waves appear.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is briefly performed and stopped at the patient's request, producing no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces a minimal symmetric photic
driving response.  HR is 60.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 41-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The shoulder movements occurred whenever the patient relaxed, but would disappear whenever she paid attention.  Symptoms were marked at first, and she received a small dose of benzodiazepines.  The patient received an infusion of normal saline and then an infusion of benzodiazepines in this record for these symptoms.  She complained of occasional focal sternal chest pain during the study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is awake with a 9.5 to 10 Hz, 40 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The patient had involuntary shuttering, which did not produce a great deal of artifact in the EEG.  The EEG remained interpretable throughout.  She received an infusion of saline, which did not particularly help the symptoms.  She was more focused on her chest wall discomfort.  The patient subsequently received 1 mg of Valium, which made her somewhat drowsy and the symptoms disappeared considerably. Vertex waves were seen in stage I sleep.

MEDICATIONS: Valium and Benadryl.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The shoulder movements occurred whenever the patient relaxed, but would disappear whenever she paid attention.  Symptoms were marked at first, and she received a small dose of benzodiazepines.  The patient received an infusion of normal saline and then an infusion of benzodiazepines in this record for these symptoms.  She complained of occasional focal sternal chest pain during the study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is awake with a 9.5 to 10 Hz, 40 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The patient had involuntary shuttering, which did not produce a great deal of artifact in the EEG.  The EEG remained interpretable throughout.  She received an infusion of saline, which did not particularly help the symptoms.  She was more focused on her chest wall discomfort.  The patient subsequently received 1 mg of Valium, which made her somewhat drowsy and the symptoms disappeared considerably. Vertex waves were seen in stage I sleep.
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving with at times supraharmonic driving.
HR:  56 to 64 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  There was no EEG signature noted for this patient’s jerking events.  Of note, the administration of benzodiazepines did increase the beta activity in the background.

Last seizure in 1975, now with severe frontal headaches (right-sided) and vertigo for two years.
MEDICATIONS: Metformin, Leptopril, and insulin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is 7.5 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  A probable MU rhythm is seen, but testing is not performed to confirm this.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background beta, as well as slow rolling eye movements and mild slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, producing some rhythmic, higher amplitude slowing, but no epileptiform activity.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  At photic stimulation of 21 Hz, there is a single frontal burst of theta, but no definitive photoparoxysmal response.
HR:  104 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This EEG must be considered within  normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: With a history of petit mal epilepsy in childhood in an adult, one would be looking for a generalized 3 to 5 Hz spike and slow wave discharges.  These are typically accentuated by hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  Unfortunately, we were not able to elicit these today.  If ongoing absence seizures are important, a repeat fasting study may be helpful.  Alternatively, one with additional hyperventilation would be useful.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an one hour EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The alpha rhythm is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Drowsiness is characterized by temporal theta and occasional wicket.  On one occasion, in the transition to drowsiness, two small discrete right temporal sharp waves are identified.  In stage II sleep, there are vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  The stage II sleep is remarkable for single channel artifact in T6 and attenuation in the T4-F8 chain.  Photic stimulation does not elicit a driving response.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG,
LENGTH OF STUDY:  23 minutes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  During very brief wakefulness, the posterior dominant rhythm reaches 11 to 12 Hz alpha that attenuates with eye opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The patient remains asleep throughout most of the recording with normal sleep architecture seen, POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), vertex waves, sleep spindles, and K-complexes.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Photic stimulation produces no diving in the background.
FINDINGS:
Primarily asleep EEG.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal 23-minute, primarily asleep, EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 44-year-old woman with history of seizures since childhood, now transferred from Episcopal because of a seizure during a stress test and now having recurrent seizures of unresponsiveness.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection, as well as seizure detection software, nurses events, patient's alarm events were all used to review the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient has normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness, stage I, stage II, and deeper stages of sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
Abnormal discharges:  None.
Patient events:  The patient had an event at 7:26 in the morning.  She pressed the alarm, laid in bed, and became unresponsive to any verbal or motor commands.  She continued to be unresponsive for about 3 minutes, after which the doctor came in and tested her.  She started crying and appeared to be slow to answer commands, but finally ended up answering commands.  She continued crying during this event.  During the entire event there was no abnormal EEG findings and remained as a normal awake EEG.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and sleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  The patient's event in which she was unresponsive had no EEG correlate.  As such, it is consistent with the diagnosis of nonepileptic psychogenic event.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10.5 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  There is a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is sharply contoured, almost rhythmic theta activity identified in the temporal regions left greater than right. This is accentuated by hyperventilation.  It has some of the stereotypic morphologies of a normal variant, but the frequency ranges from 3.6 to 7.1 and occurs in brief paroxysmal bursts.  The patient seems to be very drowsy, drifting off into stage I sleep with vertex waves.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.
HR:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This EEG must be considered outside the range of normal due to:
The rhythmic temporal theta activity, which does not have the characteristic frequencies of a normal variant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: While the activity described above is not specifically epileptiform in nature, it renders this EEG abnormal.  Additional recording may be important to determine if this activity improves over time, or may be associated with underlying epileptiform activity.  Of note, the patient was excessively drowsy and had difficulty completing hyperventilation.

INTRODUCTION: Digital  video EEG is performed  in the lab using standard  10-20 system  of electrode  placement  with  one channel  of EKG. Photic  stimulation  was performed.   This  is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF  THE RECORD: In wakefulness,  the background  EEG is remarkable  for generalized  beta activity  and a small amount of excess theta.  The baseline heart rate is 60 BPM, increasing  substantially in photic stimulation.   The end of photic stimulation  is the one section of the record  in which  a well-defined  awake  pattern  is  identified  with  a 12 Hz,  40 uV posterior dominant  rhythm clearly  reactive  to eye movement.   This is followed  by a drowsy  pattern  with beta  activity,  POSTS,   and  spindles.        Stage  II  sleep  is  characterized   by  vertex   waves,  K complexes,  spindles, and POSTS.  Snore a1iifact is identified.
Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving. HR:   60BPM.
IMPRESSION: This EEG is considered within normal limits.
CLINICAL  CORRELATION:  When  the  patient   is  maximally   alert,  the  EEG  is  normal. However,   the initial   portion   of  the  record  suggests   some  forn1 of  hypersomnolence.    No epileptiform    features    are   noted.      Comparison  with   previous    EEGs   may   be   important. Alternatively, additional  EEG  recording  capturing  one of her frequent spells  may be necessary. The absence of epileptiform activity does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is frequently noted.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-
25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is
observed.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear
diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair effort, and produces no effect.  Stepped
photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple
flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a heart rate of ~ 60 bpm.

of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This was a 1 hour study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9-Hz 30 mV posterior
dominant rhythm. There is a scant amount of background theta observed.
Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record. Drowsiness is characterized
by slow rolling eye movements. The patient has some eyebrow twitching. The
technologist has an EMG channel for this. During awake EEG, the patient demonstrates
facial twitching. The technologist asked the patient ""Is this your typical seizure?"" The
patient answered yes, this is her typical seizure. The video demonstrates a little facial
twitching which produces artifact and the EEG demonstrates a normal awake pattern.
The facial twitching occurs later on in the record. Features of drowsiness include
attenuation of the alpha with rhythmic background slowing. Posts are observed. Photic
stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. The clinical event
recorded was not associated with epileptiform activity. In addition, bilateral motor
activity was noted. This is compatible with a nonepileptic seizure.

INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Patient is awake.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.
During this EEG the patient had a seizure. This was at 10-9-06 2006. He is lying comfortably with  a normal awake pattern. This is followed by jerking, hiccupping, and head moving from side to side. Asynchronous arm movements are noted, a little bit more so on the left arm. He turns
his head to the left, and he bounces back and forth. During the seizure a well-defined alpha
rhythm can be identified. As he rocks his head to the left, artifact is picked up on some of the scalp electrodes, but the alpha rhythm can still be seen despite the fact that he is moving about. The behavior after 43 seconds and the EEG demonstrates a normal pattern. Of note, he starts rocking his head to the right and looks to the left at the end of the event. The technologist calls the patient. He is unresponsive despite a normal awake EEG. Another event occurs at 10:10:09. He receives Ativan for the second behavior, which is not sustained. The resident comes in and examines the patient. The patient makes eye contact with the resident during the examination. By the close of the EEG he remains awake but appears more comfortable.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amounts of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.

Epileptiform detections:  None.

Electrographic seizures:  None.

Events:  Multiple practice push button were noted.  In addition, behavioral events were noted at 9:56 a.m., 12:39 p.m., 3:20 p.m., 8:45 a.m., and another on the morning of the 30th at 9:09.  Although, there was electrode artifact for the events on the evening of the 29th and the morning of the 30th, no epileptiform activity was noted for any of these events and all were associated with an otherwise normal EEG, despite some movement artifact.

Seizure semiology for 9:56 a.m. nodding and blinking. Similar behavioral changes were noted at 12:39 p.m. and at 3:20 p.m.  The seizure at 8:45 begins with nodding and blinking, and then jiggling from side to side.  The patient is with the nurse at the bedside.  The nurse is examining the patient who is responsive to the nurses intervention, although she is not speaking and does not appear to have recalled the event.

The event at 9:09 on the morning of the 30th was characterized by amnesia. The patient stated that she did not recall the physician, had not seen her before, although she was otherwise able to lie down new memories and asked appropriate questions.

1. No epileptiform discharges of any nature.
2. An otherwise normal background.
3. Multiple different behavioral spells, sometimes with staring, sometimes with psychomotor slowing, sometimes with nodding and blinking, but never with epileptiform activity, despite the clear change in patient's sensorium.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:
October 27 to October 28
Background:  In wakefulness, the background includes a well-organized 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.
Epileptiform Detections:  None.
Patient Events:  There are 3 events at 6:51, 3:53 and 4:35.  The patient pushes the button for all of the events with the exception of 1 event when the nurse was present at 6:51.  She stares off into space, is verbally unresponsive, and does not identify a code word.  In the 1st event, she stares off into space and is poorly responsive followed by some chewing movements.  She is able to follow some commands during that event.  In the other 2 events, she demonstrates tapping movements of the right hand.  For all 3 events, the EEG demonstrates a normal background.

Heart rate 60 bpm.

INTERVAL IMPRESSION AND CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This 1st 24 hours of video EEG monitoring was remarkable for a normal background in wakefulness through stage II sleep, but with 3 events without an EEG change.  The patient demonstrated impairment of awareness with the events suggesting that these events may be part of this patient's repetitive of anxiety-related seizures (nonepileptic seizures).

October 28 to October 29, 2914: During this section of the record, the patient experienced multiple nonepileptic seizures at times: 8:45, 9:48, 4:12 p.m., 6:27 p.m., 7 p.m., 8 p.m., 10:16 p.m., and midnight.

Background:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a symmetric reactive 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTs.

Interictal Epileptiform Detections:  None.

Pushbutton Events:  There are 8 push buttons, and event that occurred while the patient was unhooked. The patient described that tactile stimulation of her scalp produces the events that she experiences.  The events are experienced by the patient as being different but she is able to push the button for all events.  She is unresponsive.  She may moan, grimace and demonstrate automatisms in the right hand.  She is responsive during the events and while examined by the physician for the 8:47 a.m. event, follows commands, taking a deep breath and participating with the physical exam.  She does not recall the code word for any of the events.  She describes the events as feeling to her as if they are much different, Some of them feel to her as if she is just dropping out.  She is aware that tactile stimulation of the scalp can produce the events.

Normal EEG was  associated with all of these events.
Heart rate 66 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  This 2nd 24 hours of video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
1. Multiple events without an EEG signature but with alteration in the patient's mental status.
2. A normal background.

October 29 to October 30, 2914

INTRODUCTION:    The patient had multiple behavioral events for which she was able to push the button.  In the overnight recording, she had some problems with electrode artifact.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amounts of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.

Epileptiform detections:  None.
Electrographic seizures:  None.

Events:  Multiple practice push button were noted.  In addition, behavioral events were noted at 9:56 a.m., 12:39 p.m., 3:20 p.m., 8:45 a.m., and another on the morning of the 30th at 9:09.  Although, there was electrode artifact for the events on the evening of the 29th and the morning of the 30th, no epileptiform activity was noted for any of these events and all were associated with an otherwise normal EEG, despite some movement artifact.

Seizure semiology for 9:56 a.m. nodding and blinking. Similar behavioral changes were noted at 12:39 p.m. and at 3:20 p.m.  The seizure at 8:45 begins with nodding and blinking, and then jiggling from side to side.  The patient is with the nurse at the bedside.  The nurse is examining the patient who is responsive to the nurses intervention, although she is not speaking and does not appear to have recalled the event.

The event at 9:09 on the morning of the 30th was characterized by amnesia. The patient stated that she did not recall the physician, had not seen her before, although she asked appropriate questions and could form new memories

Heart rate 72 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  This 3-day continuous video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for:
1. No epileptiform discharges of any nature.
2. An otherwise normal background.
3. Multiple different behavioral spells, sometimes with staring, sometimes with psychomotor slowing, sometimes with nodding and blinking, but never with epileptiform activity, despite the clear change in patient's sensorium.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are congruent with the previous EEG monitoring, which did not identify an epileptiform characteristic to this patient's events.

50 to 70 meg with prominent eye movement artifact such as lateral rectus artifact. In addition, there is mu activity and temporal wicket. In hyperventilation and in a handful of occasions there is a suggestion of an underlying sharp wave in the left temporal region. Unfortunately this is the same area as remarkable for significant eye movement artifact and wicket, and some of the activity described above is clearly wicket. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Photic simulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:	60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are multiple sharply contoured normal variants or artifacts including wicket and eye artifact. No definitive epileptiform features are observed. A repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep is advised.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  25 year old male with a single seizure related to antihistamine use at age 8. Patient reports a seizure in November 2008 while taking antibiotics, Propecia, and antifungal and playing the guitar. No aura. Tonic-clonic  activity. Former premature infant with past ill-defined prenatal history.

MEDICATIONS:  Propecia, Fluconazole.

INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG  was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a 1 hour, sleep deprived, EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness  there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.  The patient transitions frequently from wakefulness  into stage 2 sleep with vertex waves I observed in stage 1 sleep.  Prominent wicket is observed bilaterally in early drowsiness.  Epochs of stage 1 and stage 2 are interrupted by snore arousals and other arousals and there is muscle artifact compatible with a bit of snoring, and some of that actually is seen just as he awakens spontaneously.  Photic stimulation elicits:  No driving today.

HR: 	60 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal nor epileptiform features were observed in this record.  Normal variants, such as wicket were observed.   In addition, snore artifact also produced some sharply contoured artifacts, again not cerebral in nature.  This is a normal EEG and is similar to the previous study.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, there is generous beta activity noted in the background. There seems to be an artifact picked up at T5. Wicket activity is identified bilaterally and is more prominent on the left. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved. Photic stimulation is performed as the patient is starting to drift off into sleep, and there is no significant
driving response.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Excess beta.
2. A normal variant; wicket; which is more prominent on the left.
3. Some technical issues with the placement of the T3 and T5 electrodes.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: If this individual is thought to have new onset epilepsy rather than panic attacks, a follow-up study in the lab capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested. The presence of the excess beta may be seen in the context of anxiety and stress, which would certainly be present for any individual attempting to have an EEG with 3 small boys. Please contact the lab if needed to reschedule or repeat the EEG with sleep or even 24 hours of home EEG monitoring.

INTRODUCTION:  A 20 minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm with generous diffuse beta.  Supra harmonic alpha rhythm is noted on some occasions at twice the frequency of the baseline alpha rhythm.
Hyperventilation produces a small increase in amplitude.
Photic stimulation produces vigorous bilateral driving.  During photic stimulation, there is a slight amplitude asymmetry, slightly higher amplitude on the left.  There also seems to be an accentuation of faster frequency activity from the left during photic stimulation.

IMPRESSION:  This is an unusual, but not pathological EEG.  It is considered within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The alpha harmonic, present bilaterally is a normal variant.  The prominent driving response is again a normal phenomenon as is the beta frequency activity.
The slightly more vigorous supra harmonic driving noted on the left, ipsilateral to the heterotopic tissue is not necessarily pathological and may be considered within the broad range of normal possibilities of photic response.

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient recalls 3 episodes.  The first is on the 19th at noon where she felt a little startled.  The second was at 10 p.m. where she felt a mini aura characterized by tingling sensation on her face.  She did not recall an episode at 5:25, although she did push the button for a tingling sensation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Random wakefulness and sleep includes a well-organized 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta activity.
Event time 11:22:  There is a burst of rhythmic left temporal theta delta with frequency evolution.  This is 5 seconds in duration.  There is no push button at that time.
Event time 5:25:20 p.m.:   A burst of rhythmic theta, frequency was subtle, frequency evolution lasting only 3 seconds.  Thirty seconds later the patient reports the mini-aura which she no longer recalled.
Event time 9:58 p.m.  No abnormalities on the EEG were identified at that time.
Event time10:25 a.m.:  There was another burst lasting 4 seconds in duration in the morning on the 20th which is similar to the 2 prior bursts.   No clinical features were recalled.
HR:    60 bpm

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient reported an aura at 8 p.m. on the 21st.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Around 8 p.m., the patient is noted to transition in and out of stage 2 sleep, waking up and falling back asleep.  Fragments of deeper stages of sleep are noted overnight.
No electrographic seizures were identified.  The seizure and spike detector did not identify any other epileptiform abnormalities.
Event time 11:55:  The patient pushes the button at 11:56:12 stating that she feels as if she is about to have an aura.  She puts her hand to her chest and later appears to be tearful.  The EEG is awake at this time.  No epileptiform features were noted.   For her 8:00 p.m. the patient reported symptoms that her throat was closing with the seizure.

HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for 3 bursts of rhythmic, paroxysmal theta, all less than 4 seconds in duration, but with frequency evolution.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's clinical symptoms did not appear to be associated with well-defined epileptiform abnormalities.  On one day, however, there were discharges which appear epileptiform in nature.  While this patient did not have any of her larger spells with head turning, a feeling as if her throat was closing or impairment of awareness, this record does not exclude a diagnosis and clinically, diagnosis may be considered.

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is seen  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges

Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 26-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges

REASON FOR STUDY:  Aortic arch bypass surgery.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes during aortic bypass surgery.  The patient was recorded during the entire procedure.  The technician was present during the entire procedure and the physician was present during the critical parts of the procedure.  Feedback was given to the surgeon about changes in the EEG.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  During the procedure the right side of the head is cooled more than the left which may effect the reading of the EEG as was noted during this case.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a baseline posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  Normal frontal central beta seen.  As the procedure goes on, the incision occurs at 9:16 in the morning, heparin is given at 9:31, bypass of the head and body is done at 9:51, aorta clamped at 9:54, cooling starts at 9:56.  During all this time the EEG is at baseline, however, around 9:56 when the cooling begins, there started to be noted some slowing, specifically around 10:01 a.m. in the morning there is an asymmetry where the right side is slightly slower than the left with some sharply contoured activity in the temporal region, that at times becomes periodic and is not clearly seen with a lower amplitude.  This pattern continues as the left hemisphere also starts to become slow, but remains asymmetric up to the time where the EEG starts becomes completely suppressed which occurs first on the right hemisphere, but completely on the entire brain at around 10:13.  At this time there is some burst suppression and by 10:25 it is in complete suppression.  There is cardiac arrest at 10:30 a.m. and he starts to be rewarmed at 10:47 a.m.  He is removed from head bypass at 10:08 a.m. and noticeable bursts of activity start to be seen at around 11:04.  The EEG returns to baseline by 11:21:36 and there is no longer an asymmetry over the right hemisphere.

All the changes that were discussed above were discussed and described to the surgeon.

IMPRESSION:  This is an EEG recording during aortic root replacement surgery with a mild asymmetry noted while cooling, thought to be related to cooling artifact of the right side of the head predominating compared to the left, which after surgery and burst suppression was achieved appeared to return to baseline.  A normal EEG at baseline was seen at the end of the surgery.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is an uneventful aortic root replacement surgery EEG recording.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 12 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by abundant vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles and POSTS.

Heart rate 78 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in a very sleepy patient.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was attempted in lab standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient has great difficulty cooperating with the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is lacking any of the normal morphologies for an adult of this age.  There is the suggestion of some sharp activity at P4; however, there are so many electrode problems that the EEG is of limited value.  Even the EKG lead did not stay on.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is quite technically limited but is remarkable for paucity of normal wave forms.

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.

No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at intermediate flash rates.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This report includes 48 hours of continuous video EEG monitoring using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  There were daily practice pushbuttons.  Seizure and spike detection software was utilized.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  October 3rd to October 4th:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a well-developed alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  In drowsiness, wicket activity as well as prominent, 5 hertz rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness was noted.
Sleep was characterized by abundant beta activity and spindles.  Sleep was relatively fragmented and snoring was noted.
Seizures:  None.
Epileptiform Activity:  None.
Practice push buttons: 11:59 and 8 p.m.  No epileptiform features noted at this time.
EEG monitoring during this section of the record did not identify epileptiform activity.
October 4th to October 5th:  During this section of the record, the patient had 1 clinical event at 11 p.m. on the night of the 4th.
Background:  In sleep, there is abundant beta activity.  No transition in and out of sleep, rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness was noted.  The awake record is well organized with symmetric reactive alpha rhythm.
Interictal epileptiform abnormalities:  None.
Epileptiform seizures:  None.
Event:  11p.m., the patient had been asleep.  She seems to be somewhat drowsy.  Prior to the event, significant noise can be appreciated in the hallway, which has made it difficult to sleep.  By 10:46, there is eye opening noted.  The event is at 11 p.m.  The patient is noted to be breathing heavily, somewhat restless.  The patient pushes the button.  The nurses enter the room.  The patient is breathing heavily.  She is not conversing with the nurses, but she is following commands.  Altered and somewhat peculiar behavior is noted and at 11:02, the patient is crying and moaning.  The patient is consoled by the nurses.  At 11:04, she is responding appropriately to the nurses, but she looks away from them.  The physician enters at 11:06.  Somewhat unusual behavior persists, although there is a great deal of movement artifact, which obscures the EKG.  The overall EEG demonstrates an awake pattern.  At 11:23, she remains tearful with a normal heart rate of 78 beats per minute.
Subsequently, the patient received a tablet of Xanax and transitions back to sleep.
Heart rate 74 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG report includes the patient's final 2 days of continuous EEG monitoring.  It is remarkable for:
Two prominent normal, but epileptiform-appearing variants, rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness in wicket.
A single spell with unusual behavior, hyperventilation, and cry, but with preserved awareness and without an EEG signature.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this section of the recording.  If the behavior in question is typical of this patient's usual seizures, this session may have answered the clinical questions.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not possible but photic stimulation was completed.  This was a 26 minute EEG which was primarily in wakefulness.  The patient had 6 clinical events during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG was well organized with a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  A total of 6 behavioral events were noted including 1 at the start of the EEG.  The patient rocks her head from side to side.  On one occasion she gasps and on another occasion, she put her hands to her throat.
All events were characterized by head rocking artifact.  No epileptiform features were identified before, during or after the event.  Immediately after the event, the EEG demonstrated an awake pattern.  The patient demonstrated psychomotor slowing, sometimes unable to answer questions, sometimes unresponsive.  On other occasions, she followed commands but was unable to speak or demonstrated psychomotor slowing.
Photic stimulation elicited brief driving.  The patient also had one of her spells during photic stimulation.  Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Multiple behavioral events with head rocking but without an epileptiform signature.
A normal awake pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no previous EEGs available for comparison.  The video and clinical correlates as well as the normal EEG during these events with unresponsiveness are more suggestive of a non-epileptiform behavior.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 53-year-old woman with history of epilepsy since age of 11.  She states that she has 2 types of seizures.  The 1st semiology of seizure starts with an aura of ear buzzing and ear fullness and at times, she has automatism on the right hand, which was described as “searching in the air.” Some seizure episodes were followed by a secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  The patient was on Topamax 25 mg twice a day and Klonopin 1 mg 3 times a day prior to admission to EMU unit.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG monitoring was performed in the EMU using the standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  An automated seizure and spike detection system and a patient activated alarm system were used.  Records were reviewed daily of EEG abnormalities and clinical events.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Interictal EEG:  From 07/02/2013 to 07/03/2013; the interictal posterior dominant rhythm consisted of 9-10 Hz activity that was moderate amount of diffuse beta activity.  Stage I sleep was characterized by disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm and the presence of vertex waves.  Stage II sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and a sleep and slow waves of stage III were also observed. Hyperventilation was performed at 9:20 A.M. by physician, which led to symmetric slowing of background. Photic stimulation was performed at 10:21 A.M. and was followed by no abnormal response or clinical seizures. (Heart rate was between 60-90 per minute and was regular.)
Clinical events: All her clinical events happened during wakefulness.
On 07/03/2013, the patient was sitting at the edge of the bed at 7:40 a.m., was being examined by physician, she reported feeling numbness and tingling in both her hands, she stated that this is one of her typical seizures episodes.  This lasted 2-3 minutes.  At 7:45:21, the patient said she does not feel numbness or tingling any more.  During this episode, the patient was awake and able to answer all questions correctly. The EEG showed an awake pattern with no ictal EEG correlation.
On 07/03/2013 at 6 a.m., the patient was lying in bed. The patient was drowsy.  Then, she woke up.  There was no jerking noted, the patient pushed the alarm button at 6:13 a.m.  EEG showed awake state with no epileptic changes.  The nurse came into the room and checked the blood pressure.
IMPRESSION:  The video EEG monitoring study was normal and did not show electrographic changes consistent with the clinical events.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The interictal EEG does not support the diagnosis of epilepsy.  The episodes are diagnostic for psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.  A simple partial seizure cannot be ruled out by this recording, although complex partial, generalized tonic clonic, and myoclonic seizures can be ruled out.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  We did not capture all the typical seizure types including the generalized tonic-clonic seizures and further long-term monitoring admissions are recommended for capturing the rest of the events.

Seizure is described as sudden onset of feeling bad smell or seeing colors or at times numbness and tingling in the left face and arm followed by loss of consciousness with no convulsion.  The episode usually last for a few minutes.  She also had, at times, she may experience staring spells lasting 25-30 seconds noted by her boyfriend.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal 300 mg b.i.d., vitamin D, Elavil, and Celexa.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG monitoring was performed in the EMU using a standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement and 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Records were daily reviewed for EEG abnormalities and clinical events.  Sleep and wakefulness were captured.  There was an automated spike in seizure detection system in place as well as patient activated alarm system.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Interictal EEG description:  In the most alert state, there was a posterior dominant rhythm with frequency of 10-11 Hz, 30-80 microvolts in amplitude seen in the occipital region.  There was presence of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which was distributed symmetrically.  A stage 1 sleep was characterized by the disappearance of alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of eye blink and muscle artifact as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and posts.  The stage 2 sleep was characterized by the presence of K complexes, sleep spindles.  A slow-wave sleep and REM sleep were also captured.  No interictal epileptiform abnormalities or evidence of focally slowing were noted.  Heart rate was approximately 70 to 90 beats per minute.
CLINICAL EVENTS:  On 08/08/2013, there was 1 pushbutton event during photic stimulation noted by technician at 1:21 p.m.  Patient was sitting on the bed complaining of smelling funny lasting for 10 seconds without any change in mental status or abnormal movements.  This episode was not associated with ictal change on EEG.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal video EEG monitoring.  No interictal epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.  The patient reported a smell of something funny, lasting 10 seconds.  At 1:21 p.m., on 08/08/2013, which were not associated with ictal change on EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  Please note that simple partial seizures are not always associated with changes on a scalp EEG.  The patient's habitual seizures were not captured.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat prolonged video EEG monitoring may be helpful.

MEDICATIONS:  Divalproex, methadone, Advair, and albuterol.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG monitoring was performed in the EMU using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  An automated seizure and spike detection system and patient activated alarm system were used.  Records were reviewed daily for EEG abnormalities and clinical events.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Interictal EEG from 08/12/2013 to 08/15/2013:  In the most alert state, there is a normal posterior dominant rhythm with a frequency of 9-10 Hz seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta activity.  The stage I sleep was characterized by the disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of eye blink and muscle artifact, vertex sharp waves, and posts.  The stage II sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  The deeper stages of sleep were characterized by increasing amounts of delta frequency activity.  REM sleep was also captured.  Heart rate was 70-80 beats per minutes and regular.

Clinical events:  On 08/13/2013 at 7:25 p.m., there is a push button event as the patient lying in bed.  The nurse is in to check while the patient's head turned to the right with jerking in right shoulder for a few seconds.  EEG showed no ictal change.  There was normal awake background.

IMPRESSION:  This is a normal video EEG monitoring study with no interictal epileptiform abnormalities.  Patient had 1 event consisting of right arm shaking for a few seconds with no change in mental status.  There were no associated ictal changes on EEG.

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG and seizure and spike detection software.  This was a technically acceptable 24-hour recording.
EVENTS: During the EEG monitoring session, the patient had 19 push button spells for a funny taste or smell.  These included 7:41, 8:04, 9:25, 9:33, 10:16, 10:30, 10:37, 11:11, 11:32, 11:44, 1:11, 3:05, 3:54, 6:59, 8:50, 10:09, 11:03, 3:05, and 7 p.m.  The EEG demonstrated a normal pattern with a heart rate of a 70-80 bpm.
INTERICTAL EEG:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient has somewhat disrupted sleep, but did get to sleep a little earlier on the night of the 17th.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with POSTS noted in stage 1 sleep.  Brief stage 2 sleep includes spindles and K complexes.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: NONE
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This 2nd day of continuous video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
Normal awake and a sleep record, although there was limited sleep.
Nineteen push button events without EEG change  on the final day of recording
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No evidence of epilepsy was found.  These findings were discussed with the patient and a diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures was reviewed with the patient, which she understood at the conclusion of her EEG monitoring.

DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  In wakefulness, there is a fair amount of chew artifact.  Lambda was noted.
As the patient drifts off to sleep there is an increase in beta.  There is the appearance of posteriorly predominant slowing as well as electrocardiogram artifact and as the patient becomes drowsy there is a bit more head rocking, but a suggestion of slowing in the right occipital region relative to the left.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
HEART RATE 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is likely within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  There were no major abnormalities and the asymmetry noted in the occipital regions may represent head rocking artifact as the patient drifts off to sleep.  If additional information is needed, a more prolonged sleep EEG may be of value.  In addition, if this patient is thought to have sleep paralysis, a formal sleep study may be helpful.  Alternatively, consider a 1 hour EEG in the lab with a muscle monitor to look for evidence of reduced muscle tone in states other REM sleep.

This is a technically satisfactory EEG, although impedance in the T1-T2 electrodes are just above 5 kilohms.  There are no previous EEGs available for comparison.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Scant theta is noted in the background.  The patient is very drowsy with transitions in and out of stage 1 sleep with slow rolling eye movements.
In drowsiness, there are a handful of bursts of shifting slowing as well as a synchronous eye artifact.
Hyperventilation produces a small increase in theta.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting off to sleep, but did elicit a driving response.

Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for -17 hours from -1 pm on 12/22/2013 till - 6 am on 12/23/2013.  Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.  All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist. The Gotman spike and seizure detection algorithm (Stellate) was used to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges.

Description of pushbutton events
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear. Slow wave sleep and REM sleep are captured.
No typical events are captured.

Description:
Patient is awake by the end of the recording. Waking background is characterized by low amplitude 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.

INTRODUCTION:  A 36-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  The patient had 2 events during hyperventilation lasting approximately 1.3 and 6 minutes in duration.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with 11 Hz alpha rhythm, a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity, alpha squeak, as well as lambda.  Brief drowsiness was achieved at the end of the record and was characterized by attenuation of the alpha and an increase in beta.
Photic stimulation did not produce pathological findings, but did produce a driving response.
Hyperventilation:  Hyperventilation produced 2 spells of unresponsiveness.  The patient demonstrated eye fluttering, unresponsiveness, impaired ability to recall a code word and jerking of the upper extremities and shaking.  Her companion was with her and reported that these were typical of the patient's spells and, if the patient was standing, the patient would have dropped to the floor.
The patient was examined during the spells.  Although she was unable to recall code word, she demonstrated soft protective movements.  A normal alpha rhythm was noted when she stopped fluttering in her eyes.

INTRODUCTION:  A 40-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This adult had difficulty cooperating with testing.  Impedances were challenging and muscle artifact was difficult to eliminate.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a well organized pattern with generous beta.  An 11 Hz alpha rhythm was noted with generous, low voltage, frontal central beta.  In relaxed wakefulness and early drowsiness, a 5.6 hertz rhythmic, mid temporal theta was noted.  This may be identified unilaterally or bilaterally with most burst of 5-7 seconds in duration, some somewhat longer.
No slowing was noted following these bursts of 5.6 second activity.  The technologist was not able to test the patient during the bursts.  Afterwards, no impairment of awareness was noted.
Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta with attenuation of the alpha rhythm, but deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.
Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta and may accentuate the 5.6 hertz activity.  Despite the muscle artifact, photic driving response was noted.
Heart rate 66 to 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging, but EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This theta described above as the characteristics of a normal variant.  This EEG was remarkable for a significant amount of muscle artifact as well as the failure to perform testing during the discharges.

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring continues for 22-year-old male with staring spells.  The patient had multiple push buttons for staring spells during this 24-hour section.
Background:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Abundant stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  Of note, sleep was relatively disrupted on the 1st day, but the patient seemed to be having more extensive stage 2 sleep early in the morning on the 24th.  In stage 2 sleep, occasional beta spindles were noted.  REM sleep was noted during multiple sections of the overnight recording with multiple spontaneous brief arousals from REM sleep.  There may have been some snore artifact noted at other times, but the arousals from REM sleep were not associated with epileptiform activity or significant snoring that could be detected by the recording strategy employed.
Epileptiform seizures:  None.
Pushbuttons:  On the 24th, there were 17 push button events.  Two of these were practice pushbuttons.  These events span primarily around 12:19 p.m., but standard time from 12:07 p.m. until 1:57 p.m., and then again 3:31, 4:32, and 7:18:45.  The patient is communicative and conversing with the nurse during the blinking spells.  He is awake during all of them.  After sometime, the nursing staff does not enter for every spell, but the patient can be seen clearly involved and engaged in activities and in some cases talking on the phone.  No epileptiform features were identified with the push buttons.  The EEG consistently demonstrates a normal awake pattern, although he does have some increase in heart rate.  For the 1:57 p.m. event, the patient does demonstrate a clear change in heart rate with a somewhat irregular heart rate at the end.
Epileptiform Detections:  Rare epileptiform detections were noted exclusively in sleep in this section of the record.  They are primarily seen in stage 2 sleep and include frontally predominant 2.5 to 4 Hz spike and wave activity as well as a isolated spike and wave activity.  With review using an average reference, some of the isolated spikes demonstrate a maximum between FC and F3.
Heart rate 60 to 90 to 130 BPM bpm
IMPRESSION:  This 48 hour EEG monitoring session was remarkable for:
An interictal EEG, which demonstrates spike and wave and slow spike and wave activity, at this time, exclusively in sleep, similar to the previous EEG monitoring from 2006 to 2010.
Some spike and wave activity demonstrates L FC maximum.
Multiple episodes of blinking, involuntary blinking noted and wakefulness.  No EEG change noted. Patient is awake and alert for all
On rare occasions, an irregular heart rate.
Disrupted sleep with multiple arousals from REM sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted in association with the patient staring and blinking.  The irregular heart rate was also noted without clinical symptoms and referral for Cardiology consultation may be considered.

INTRODUCTION:  Routine 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This EEG captures wakefulness through sleep.  It is a technically acceptable EEG with most impedances below 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is low voltage, but there is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  The patient transitions rapidly between wakefulness and stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, spindles, and POSTS.
Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate: 60 to 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG is well organized with symmetric reactive 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  The patient seems to be quite drowsy and transitions frequently between wakefulness and stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.
Hyperventilation produces a small increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation is performed with a great deal of artifact, but does elicit a driving response.
