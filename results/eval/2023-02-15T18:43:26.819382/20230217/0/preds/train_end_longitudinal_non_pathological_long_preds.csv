INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This patient and the parent report that the patient’s symptoms of staring and spacing have dramatically reduced at this time.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for an individual of this age with a 9 Hz, 70 V posterior dominant rhythm and posterior slow waves of youth.  LAMBDA activity is noted when the patient looks about the room.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increase in background theta.  Following hyperventilation, as the patient becomes drowsy, vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles are seen in stage II sleep.  Of note, even prior to hyperventilation when the patient is looking about the room, when not stimulated, she seems to become drowsy with brief vertex waves followed by an alerting.
Photic stimulation elicits symmetric driving.
HR:  70 to 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  In contrast to her previous record, no temporal wicket was identified in this record.

INTRODUCTION: Sleep deprived digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9.5 Hz, 60 V posterior dominant rhythm in what appears to be posterior slow waves of youth.  The patient becomes quite drowsy and in drowsiness there are hypersynchronous bursts of rhythmic, high amplitude frontal theta and delta.  On one or two occasions, this appears to be a notch, but there is no definitive spike and slow wave activity.  Features of stage II sleep include vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces bursts of rhythmic, relatively symmetric high amplitude mixed theta and delta activity.  On one or two occasions this is notched, but again there is no definitive epileptiform activity.  Immediately following hyperventilation, as the patient becomes drowsy, there is a single right temporal sharp wave.
Photic stimulation elicits brief driving.
HR:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This EEG must be considered within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No definitive epileptiform features were identified in this record.  While there is some notched, rhythmic, frontal slowing, there is no definitive spike and slow wave activity.  In addition, with a single right temporal sharp wave, this must be considered artifactual rather than necessarily indicative of epileptiform activity.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is a one-hour EEG.  The patient experienced some of her symptoms during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is awake, alert, and interactive.  She is observed to have tremulousness of the arms and face in wakefulness without EEG change.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record with poor effort.  This increases the patient’s trembling including facial twitching and the patient is slow to respond, however, the EEG throughout the entire hyperventilation is normal.  During this one-hour EEG, the patient again experiences the arm and face trembling at 11:02.  The tech again performs testing.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric and low voltage.  There is an 8 Hz, 20 V posterior dominant rhythm and excessively diffuse beta activity.  The patient easily fell to sleep and frequent REM sleep was recorded.  The patient would wake up from REM sleep and then fall back to sleep.  POSTS activity was recognized in light sleep, and rhythmic slowing was seen in drowsiness.  Stage ___ Sleep was evidenced by a mixed frequency-----, and REM sleep was evidenced by rapid oscillatory eye movements with a low voltage background.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The technologist has difficulty communicating with the patient and therefore it is difficult to assess maximal wakefulness.  In maximum wakefulness, the EEG appears to be reasonably well organized with a 9 Hz, 30 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in background beta activity.  There may be an area of very subtle accentuation of beta in the right centrotemporal region.  Vertex waves are seen in stage I sleep.  POSTS are noted in stage I sleep as well.  Vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles are seen in stage II sleep.  Stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.

TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:




The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During very drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with fair cooperation and produces
no effect.




Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.

MEDICATIONS: Compazine, Ativan, thiamine, and Zyprexa.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient was medicated with Ativan prior to the test. The patient has modest, involuntary movements.  She has none of her severe spasms.  Stimulation of the patient in an attempt to elicit the spasms is not performed.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is rich in beta frequency activity.  In maximal weakness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz, with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  As she becomes drowsy, there is an increase in background beta activity with occasional vertex waves.  The overall background is low voltage.
Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving response at 3 Hz and faster flash frequencies.
HR:  112 BPM, with rare PVCs.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage I sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The generous beta may be due to this patient’s medications.  In that this patient’s left-sided motor activity had been thought to be epileptiform in nature, if desired, a repeat EEG with stimulation of the patient to elicit the motor would be helpful.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 30 to 50 V posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In relaxed wakefulness and early drowsiness, there is rhythmic, 5 Hz, sharply contoured activity with a flat-top shape in the left temporal region.  This may appear in bursts lasting up to 1.5 seconds.  There is a very slight degree of variability in the activity.  Identical, 5.2 Hz activity is identified from the right in similar states.

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of low voltage 9 Hz alpha
and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior
gradient.  Alpha activity attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. A moderate amount of muscle
artifact is seen.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None

symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Hr was
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a well-organized background with a 10 Hz symmetric, reactive posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is temporal wicket activity identified.  The wicket activity on the left is slightly higher amplitude and it is slightly irritative in its nature, but there is no definite spike or slow wave activity.  As the patient reaches deeper stages of sleep, there are vertex waves and POSTS, but deeper stages of sleep are not sustained and the patient intermittently arouses from sleep. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is relatively drowsy and does not activate the record.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This EEG is at the limits of normal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is no definite epileptiform activity, although there is some suspicious activity underlying what is likely a normal variant.  To clarify this, a repeat study with more prolonged sleep would be helpful to determine if in fact there is underlying left temporal sharp activity.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a well organized 11 Hz, 15 to 20 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there are intermittent wicket spikes identified more from the left than the right temporal regions, which disappear in stage II sleep.  Stage II sleep is characterized by vertex waves and spindles.  There is also the occurrence of benign sleep transience in this patient, as well as vertex sharp waves.
Photic stimulation activates the record at higher flash frequencies to some degree.
HR:  74 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The wicket spike activity disappears in stage II sleep, which signifies a benign variant of EEG changes. A sleep deprived EEG would be useful in order to identify latent epileptiform activity in the temporal areas.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and


photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically


with eye opening.  Generous beta activity is noted


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Prominent wicket activity is identified, left greater than right



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:      Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic

stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric


photic driving, which is a normal finding.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial portions of the record include an awake child with a rhythmic, relatively symmetric pattern with the appearance of some 4 to 5 Hz activity in the posterior regions.  As the child goes off to sleep, there is some artifact, but there is also some fast activity in what appears to be vertex activity at CZ.  The initial record is medium amplitude for a child of this age, and the sleep record is somewhat higher amplitude; again, as the recording continues, with more beta and vertex-like activity identified in the central regions.  There are some occasional electrode pops, but no definite sharp waves are seen in this record.  The overall background is continuous and appropriately symmetric.  At the close of the record, increasing quantities of delta are seen in sleep and then there is what is probably early spindle-like activity in the central regions.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is a one-hour EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for age with a 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is occasional focal slowing with isolated arrhythmic theta or delta from the right or left centrotemporal region.  This becomes a bit more prominent as the patient becomes drowsy.  Occasional EKG artifact is noted.
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving, which is slightly higher amplitude on the right compared to the left.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is quite drowsy throughout much of the record, but in maximal wakefulness there is a well defined 9 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm and a more diffuse distribution of the beta activity as well as wicket.  Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving. Hyperventilation does not activate the record.

HR:  64 BPM. In this single channel EKG, there appears to be C-segment depression and a notched QRS complex.

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform discharges were identified.  This patient appears to be somewhat excessively drowsy.  Sleep deprivation may produce the background slowing described above. The referring physician will be contacted regarding the visual loss and EKG abnormalities.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  The patient had very prominent trembling throughout the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Despite the tremble artifact, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with generous, diffuse theta, and significant head rocking artifact.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in beta.  With instruction, such as asking the patient to count backwards from 10, the patient stops trembling quite so much.
Photic stimulation was remarkable for more trembling and scant driving.
Heart rate:  70 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is likely within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  EEG recording for this patient is likely normal but unfortunately, the patient was not able to stop her head trembling consistently.  In the brief sections where she was able to stop the head trembling, the EEG does appear normal.  This is the third EEG for this patient without epileptiform activity but this EEG did seem to capture much more of her clinical symptoms which are not associated with epileptiform discharges.

Of note, in the last EEG, the patient had harmonic and subharmonic driving, which were not seen today.  This may be due to the fact that the patient was falling asleep in photic stimulation.  Given the patient’s history of seizures during sleep and the snoring and arousals from sleep identified here, perhaps a polysomnogram should be considered.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10.5 Hz, 70 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, increasing the amplitude and producing a small amount of slowing.  This is followed by drowsiness with slow rolling eye movements.  Vertex waves are seen in stage I sleep.   Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.

INTRODUCTION: This is a one-hour digital video EEG performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  Induction of cold is also attempted.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is high amplitude, sharply contoured with a 10 Hz, 70 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of beta activity.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing an increase in the amplitude of the background, as well as some head-rocking artifact.  Temporal wicket activity is seen.  Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.  The patient and the technologist work to produce a cold-like artifact or sensation.  The patient reports that this gives her some of her symptoms, but not one of her typical spells.  The EEG around the time that the patient becomes cold actually shows that she is drifting off to sleep with vertex waves.  Stage II sleep includes high amplitude vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  Sharply contoured POSTS are also identified.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel one hour electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, hyperventilation, and photic
stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by symmetric and reactive 20-30 uV 9-10 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Low amplitude
frontocentral 18-30 Hz activity was seen. Moderate amounts of low amplitude muscle artifact, EKG
artifact, and occasional electrode artifact were noted.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured


No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy one hour EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

SEDATION: TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recording using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes was performed utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation .



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



There are normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes present during Stage II sleep. Slow wave sleep is not captured.

No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES :



Hyperventilation: was deferred, due to pulmonary issues Photic Stimulation: elicits minimal driving

EVENTS:

INTRODUCTION:	Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The child is initially very agitated and cranky. His mother is in the bed with him attempting, with limited success, to console him.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	In wakefulness, when the child is cooperative, there is a 7 Hz, symmetric reactive posterior dominant rhythm. Hypnagogic hypersynchrony is observed in drowsiness  followed by vertex waves, K complex, and spindles. When child makes a transition to delta sleep with high amplitude delta observed in the background.
HR: 120-150 bpm
IMPRESSION: 	EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	No focal nor epileptiform features are identified this record. None were seen in 2007. If epilepsy is an important consideration,  a repeat, more prolonged study in the lab may be helpful. The presence of delta sleep in a routine EEG may be part
of this child's sleep deficit or be associated with medications that
he had received prior to the EEG in the ICU.

MEDICATIONS: Valium and Benadryl.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The shoulder movements occurred whenever the patient relaxed, but would disappear whenever she paid attention.  Symptoms were marked at first, and she received a small dose of benzodiazepines.  The patient received an infusion of normal saline and then an infusion of benzodiazepines in this record for these symptoms.  She complained of occasional focal sternal chest pain during the study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is awake with a 9.5 to 10 Hz, 40 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The patient had involuntary shuttering, which did not produce a great deal of artifact in the EEG.  The EEG remained interpretable throughout.  She received an infusion of saline, which did not particularly help the symptoms.  She was more focused on her chest wall discomfort.  The patient subsequently received 1 mg of Valium, which made her somewhat drowsy and the symptoms disappeared considerably. Vertex waves were seen in stage I sleep.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is 7.5 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  A probable MU rhythm is seen, but testing is not performed to confirm this.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background beta, as well as slow rolling eye movements and mild slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, producing some rhythmic, higher amplitude slowing, but no epileptiform activity.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  At photic stimulation of 21 Hz, there is a single frontal burst of theta, but no definitive photoparoxysmal response.
HR:  104 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This EEG must be considered within  normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: With a history of petit mal epilepsy in childhood in an adult, one would be looking for a generalized 3 to 5 Hz spike and slow wave discharges.  These are typically accentuated by hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  Unfortunately, we were not able to elicit these today.  If ongoing absence seizures are important, a repeat fasting study may be helpful.  Alternatively, one with additional hyperventilation would be useful.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:




A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta


activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 12 Hertz


posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes. Note

that patient was asleep during part of the stimulation.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with attenuation of the alpha rhythm and vertex waves and spindles in stage II sleep.  The patient moans sometimes in stage I sleep.  Stimulation is performed while the patient is in stage II sleep and does not activate the record.
HR:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Of note, the patient was examined extensively during the EEG.  In the initial portions of the record, she reports that she can’t move her arms or legs, but she can feel cold.  With reassurance and encouragement, she is able to demonstrate a normal neurologic examination.

SEDATION: none



TECHNIQUE:

A  1 hour Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and


photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.5

Hertz  55 uV posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  REM sleep WAS

captured.


The patient sometimes coughs in sleep, limited muscle artifact

was seen in sleep.

No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces mild diffuse symmetric

background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which


is a normal finding.  Patient was falling asleep


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep 1 HOUR EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.

REM sleep in a 1 hour EEG,albeit brief, may be correlated with


clinical history.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of


epilepsy.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an alpha rhythm of 9 Hz, 40 uV with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in background slowing with slow rolling eye movements.  Other features of drowsiness include an increase in rhythmic theta.  Photic stimulation is performed as the patient is drifting off to sleep, but a driving response is elicited, particularly at faster flash frequencies.
HR:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits for a subject of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  There is some age appropriate temporal slowing seen in the transition to drowsiness.  This is this patient’s second normal EEG

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by wicket rhythm identified bilaterally.  In drowsiness, a breach rhythm can be identified with increased amplitude from the left.  Other features of drowsiness include an increase in background theta.  Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta.
HR:  70 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG demonstrates acceptable quantities of background theta for an adult of this age.  A breach rhythm is an anticipated finding following craniotomy.  No epileptiform features were seen.  In comparison to previous records, this EEG shows an increasing faster frequency activity.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG is well organized with a 9.5 Hz 30 mV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta. MU activity is observed, but testing is not performed to confirm this.  There is a slight asymmetry with a bit more anterior spread of faster frequency activity on the right compared to the left.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and an increase in beta. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous, bilateral driving with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.

HR:    60 bpm

IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A breech rhythm may account for the asymmetries described above.  Supraharmonic driving is a normal phenomenon.

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:




The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an one hour EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The alpha rhythm is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Drowsiness is characterized by temporal theta and occasional wicket.  On one occasion, in the transition to drowsiness, two small discrete right temporal sharp waves are identified.  In stage II sleep, there are vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  The stage II sleep is remarkable for single channel artifact in T6 and attenuation in the T4-F8 chain.  Photic stimulation does not elicit a driving response.
HR:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This EEG must be considered within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The two discrete sharp waves may represent a normal variant.  Because of the artifact described above, this study should be repeated with greater attention to electrode placement.  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The T4 electrode showed sub-optimal placement.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The patient was poorly relaxed with a large amount of muscle artifact and frontal eye movement
artifact throughout the record. The waking demonstrates a large amount of generalized low to
medium amplitude 16-25 Hz activity and a small amount of low to medium voltage posteriorly
dominant 10-12 Hz rhythmic activity.  Posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) attenuates symmetrically with
eye opening.





Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:






Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 76 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an awake patient.  At times the patient is in pain, with his hands clenched in almost a cortical posture and some head-rocking artifact in the occipital scalp regions.  The EEG, however, demonstrates a well organized pattern with an 11 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10.5 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  There is a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is sharply contoured, almost rhythmic theta activity identified in the temporal regions left greater than right. This is accentuated by hyperventilation.  It has some of the stereotypic morphologies of a normal variant, but the frequency ranges from 3.6 to 7.1 and occurs in brief paroxysmal bursts.  The patient seems to be very drowsy, drifting off into stage I sleep with vertex waves.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.
HR:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This EEG must be considered outside the range of normal due to:
The rhythmic temporal theta activity, which does not have the characteristic frequencies of a normal variant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: While the activity described above is not specifically epileptiform in nature, it renders this EEG abnormal.  Additional recording may be important to determine if this activity improves over time, or may be associated with underlying epileptiform activity.  Of note, the patient was excessively drowsy and had difficulty completing hyperventilation.

The patient arouses readily and there is a symmetric, reactive 10.5 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  When hyperventilation is performed, the patient alerts briefly then drifts off to sleep.  In sleep, there is a suggestion of an amplitude asymmetry with somewhat higher activity in the left frontal region compared to the right.
Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is asleep, but there is a trivial driving response.
HR:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The breach rhythm seen in sleep with slightly higher amplitude activity is compatible with a previous craniotomy.  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record, hence, this is a normal EEG.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a low voltage, low-to-medium amplitude pattern, with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Much of the record includes a drowsy pattern with slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing some bursts of paroxysmal slowing, which are overall symmetric.  In the transition to stage II sleep, there are occasional bursts of rhythmic frontal slowing, but without clear lateralization.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is frequently noted.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-
25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is
observed.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear
diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair effort, and produces no effect.  Stepped
photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple
flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a heart rate of ~ 60 bpm.

Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2

INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Patient is awake.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.
During this EEG the patient had a seizure. This was at 10-9-06 2006. He is lying comfortably with  a normal awake pattern. This is followed by jerking, hiccupping, and head moving from side to side. Asynchronous arm movements are noted, a little bit more so on the left arm. He turns
his head to the left, and he bounces back and forth. During the seizure a well-defined alpha
rhythm can be identified. As he rocks his head to the left, artifact is picked up on some of the scalp electrodes, but the alpha rhythm can still be seen despite the fact that he is moving about. The behavior after 43 seconds and the EEG demonstrates a normal pattern. Of note, he starts rocking his head to the right and looks to the left at the end of the event. The technologist calls the patient. He is unresponsive despite a normal awake EEG. Another event occurs at 10:10:09. He receives Ativan for the second behavior, which is not sustained.

HR: 74 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If there is a concern for this diagnosis, could repeat the EEG with sleep deprivation since no sleep is recorded in this record.

62 y.o. female with a history of seizures and

extrapyramidal symptoms referred for routine EEG for


characterization of seizures.


MEDICATIONS: VALPROIC, COGENTIN, RISPERDAL, INDERAL, PROTONIX,


ROBINUL, KLONOPIN, METOPROLOL, AMLODIPINE, BACLOFEN


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and an excess amount of bifrontal beta activity,

organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening.



Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only routine EEG.  There are no clinical


or electrographic events reported or detected.

Excess beta activity may be seen in the setting of certain


medications such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake only routine EEG.


Excess beta activity may be seen in the setting of certain

medications such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.


If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.

She stares off into space, is verbally unresponsive, and does not identify a code word.  In the 1st event, she stares off into space and is poorly responsive followed by some chewing movements.  She is able to follow some commands during that event.  In the other 2 events, she demonstrates tapping movements of the right hand.  For all 3 events, the EEG demonstrates a normal background.

Heart rate 60 bpm.

INTERVAL IMPRESSION AND CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This 1st 24 hours of video EEG monitoring was remarkable for a normal background in wakefulness through stage II sleep, but with 3 events without an EEG change.  The patient demonstrated impairment of awareness with the events suggesting that these events may be part of this patient's repetitive of anxiety-related seizures (nonepileptic seizures).

October 28 to October 29, 2914: During this section of the record, the patient experienced multiple nonepileptic seizures at times: 8:45, 9:48, 4:12 p.m., 6:27 p.m., 7 p.m., 8 p.m., 10:16 p.m., and midnight.

Interictal Epileptiform Detections:  None.

Pushbutton Events:  There are 8 push buttons, and event that occurred while the patient was unhooked. The patient described that tactile stimulation of her scalp produces the events that she experiences.  The events are experienced by the patient as being different but she is able to push the button for all events.  She is unresponsive.  She may moan, grimace and demonstrate automatisms in the right hand.  She is responsive during the events and while examined by the physician for the 8:47 a.m. event, follows commands, taking a deep breath and participating with the physical exam.  She does not recall the code word for any of the events.  She describes the events as feeling to her as if they are much different, Some of them feel to her as if she is just dropping out.  She is aware that tactile stimulation of the scalp can produce the events.

Normal EEG was  associated with all of these events.
Heart rate 66 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  This 2nd 24 hours of video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
1. Multiple events without an EEG signature but with alteration in the patient's mental status.
2. A normal background.

She stares off into space, is verbally unresponsive, and does not identify a code word.  In the 1st event, she stares off into space and is poorly responsive followed by some chewing movements.  She is able to follow some commands during that event.  In the other 2 events, she demonstrates tapping movements of the right hand.  For all 3 events, the EEG demonstrates a normal background.

Heart rate 60 bpm.

INTERVAL IMPRESSION AND CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This 1st 24 hours of video EEG monitoring was remarkable for a normal background in wakefulness through stage II sleep, but with 3 events without an EEG change.  The patient demonstrated impairment of awareness with the events suggesting that these events may be part of this patient's repetitive of anxiety-related seizures (nonepileptic seizures).

October 28 to October 29, 2914: During this section of the record, the patient experienced multiple nonepileptic seizures at times: 8:45, 9:48, 4:12 p.m., 6:27 p.m., 7 p.m., 8 p.m., 10:16 p.m., and midnight.

Background:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a symmetric reactive 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTs.

Interictal Epileptiform Detections:  None.

Pushbutton Events:  There are 8 push buttons, and event that occurred while the patient was unhooked. The patient described that tactile stimulation of her scalp produces the events that she experiences.  The events are experienced by the patient as being different but she is able to push the button for all events.  She is unresponsive.  She may moan, grimace and demonstrate automatisms in the right hand.  She is responsive during the events and while examined by the physician for the 8:47 a.m. event, follows commands, taking a deep breath and participating with the physical exam.  She does not recall the code word for any of the events.  She describes the events as feeling to her as if they are much different, Some of them feel to her as if she is just dropping out.  She is aware that tactile stimulation of the scalp can produce the events.

Normal EEG was  associated with all of these events.
Heart rate 66 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  This 2nd 24 hours of video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
1. Multiple events without an EEG signature but with alteration in the patient's mental status.
2. A normal background.

October 29 to October 30, 2914

INTRODUCTION:    The patient had multiple behavioral events for which she was able to push the button.  In the overnight recording, she had some problems with electrode artifact.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amounts of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.

Epileptiform detections:  None.
Electrographic seizures:  None.

Events:  Multiple practice push button were noted.  In addition, behavioral events were noted at 9:56 a.m., 12:39 p.m., 3:20 p.m., 8:45 a.m., and another on the morning of the 30th at 9:09.  Although, there was electrode artifact for the events on the evening of the 29th and the morning of the 30th, no epileptiform activity was noted for any of these events and all were associated with an otherwise normal EEG, despite some movement artifact.

Seizure semiology for 9:56 a.m. nodding and blinking. Similar behavioral changes were noted at 12:39 p.m. and at 3:20 p.m.  The seizure at 8:45 begins with nodding and blinking, and then jiggling from side to side.  The patient is with the nurse at the bedside.  The nurse is examining the patient who is responsive to the nurses intervention, although she is not speaking and does not appear to have recalled the event.

The event at 9:09 on the morning of the 30th was characterized by amnesia. The patient stated that she did not recall the physician, had not seen her before, although she asked appropriate questions and could form new memories

Heart rate 72 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  This 3-day continuous video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for:
1. No epileptiform discharges of any nature.
2. An otherwise normal background.
3. Multiple different behavioral spells, sometimes with staring, sometimes with psychomotor slowing, sometimes with nodding and blinking, but never with epileptiform activity, despite the clear change in patient's sensorium.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are congruent with the previous EEG monitoring, which did not identify an epileptiform characteristic to this patient's events.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed   in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement  with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and Photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   In wakefulness, there is a 10.8 Hz alpha rhythm of
50 to 70 meg with prominent eye movement artifact such as lateral rectus artifact. In addition, there is mu activity and temporal wicket. In hyperventilation and in a handful of occasions there is a suggestion of an underlying sharp wave in the left temporal region. Unfortunately this is the same area as remarkable for significant eye movement artifact and wicket, and some of the activity described above is clearly wicket. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Photic simulation elicits bilateral driving.

INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG  was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a 1 hour, sleep deprived, EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness  there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.  The patient transitions frequently from wakefulness  into stage 2 sleep with vertex waves I observed in stage 1 sleep.  Prominent wicket is observed bilaterally in early drowsiness.  Epochs of stage 1 and stage 2 are interrupted by snore arousals and other arousals and there is muscle artifact compatible with a bit of snoring, and some of that actually is seen just as he awakens spontaneously.  Photic stimulation elicits:  No driving today.

HR: 	60 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal nor epileptiform features were observed in this record.  Normal variants, such as wicket were observed.   In addition, snore artifact also produced some sharply contoured artifacts, again not cerebral in nature.  This is a normal EEG and is similar to the previous study.

INTRODUCTION: Digital and video EEG was performed in the laboratory using the standard  10/20 system of electrode placement with one-channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This was an awake through night sleepiness record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: On wakefulness the background EEG is symmetric, continuous, and fairly well-organized for her age.  There is a 10 Hz, 50 microvolts posterior dominant alpha rhythm which is well-attenuated with eyes opened. There is a small low voltage frontal central beta activity. Hyperventilation with good effort produced small snow activity on the background but no abnormal discharges. Sleepiness is evidenced by reduced amplitude of the background as well as mildly increased snow activity but no abnormal findings.  Photic stimulation created a driving.
Heart rate was 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and night sleepiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal findings, no epileptiform discharges were seen in this tracing.  Abnormal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, there is generous beta activity noted in the background. There seems to be an artifact picked up at T5. Wicket activity is identified bilaterally and is more prominent on the left. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved. Photic stimulation is performed as the patient is starting to drift off into sleep, and there is no significant
driving response.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Excess beta.
2. A normal variant; wicket; which is more prominent on the left.
3. Some technical issues with the placement of the T3 and T5 electrodes.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: If this individual is thought to have new onset epilepsy rather than panic attacks, a follow-up study in the lab capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested. The presence of the excess beta may be seen in the context of anxiety and stress, which would certainly be present for any individual attempting to have an EEG with 3 small boys. Please contact the lab if needed to reschedule or repeat the EEG with sleep or even 24 hours of home EEG monitoring.

INTRODUCTION:  A 20 minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm with generous diffuse beta.  Supra harmonic alpha rhythm is noted on some occasions at twice the frequency of the baseline alpha rhythm.
Hyperventilation produces a small increase in amplitude.
Photic stimulation produces vigorous bilateral driving.  During photic stimulation, there is a slight amplitude asymmetry, slightly higher amplitude on the left.  There also seems to be an accentuation of faster frequency activity from the left during photic stimulation.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an unusual, but not pathological EEG.  It is considered within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The alpha harmonic, present bilaterally is a normal variant.  The prominent driving response is again a normal phenomenon as is the beta frequency activity.
The slightly more vigorous supra harmonic driving noted on the left, ipsilateral to the heterotopic tissue is not necessarily pathological and may be considered within the broad range of normal possibilities of photic response.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 2 day old female infant ready for discharge when the infant
began to have jerking and tremulousness. Mother subsequently disclosed exposure to
opioids. Delivered at 38-weeks by 3 5-year-old mother, weight 7 pounds 2 ounces.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. As the tracing opens the patient
has just been jerking. She has just received sedative hypnotic medications and is quite
lethargic.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial section of the record demonstrates a
pattern relatively typical for a term infant, slightly low voltage, with a bit of trache
alternans. There are occasional frontal temporal sharp waves noted in the record.
There are a handful of couplets of sharp waves at C4 or C3, as well as vertex activity,
but they are not associated with any involuntary movements.
As the recording continuous, tactile stimulation of the infant elicits an arousal pattern
with a bit more of a continuous rhythmic theta pattern. With tactile stimulation, the infant
has somewhat jerking movements in the legs, but none with an epileptiform pattern.
This EEG is recorded in 2 sections after equipment issues. Generous beta is noted in
the record with vertex waves.
By the end of the record, there is a suggestion of asynchronous vertex waves, but no
definitive or pathological epileptiform sharp waves In the central regions. At the end of
the record, there seems to be some movement artifact while the nurse is touching the
baby. The infant is carefully examined to determine if Infant is trembling or not. The
rhythmic theta artifact is produced, but tactile stimulation also produces an alerting
response in baby.

TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding. There is supraharmonic driving

Etonogestrel (NEXPLANON) 68 mg Implant, by Subdermal route.


UNKNOWN TO PATIENT, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily. Takes a red birth control pill daily
Indications: Pregnancy Contraception



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, hyperventilation, and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



A normal interictal EEG cannot exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy. If clinically indicated, a more
prolonged EEG or ambulatory recording may provide additional helpful information.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Random wakefulness and sleep includes a well-organized 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta activity.
Event time 11:22:  There is a burst of rhythmic left temporal theta delta with frequency evolution.  This is 5 seconds in duration.  There is no push button at that time.
Event time 5:25:20 p.m.:   A burst of rhythmic theta, frequency was subtle, frequency evolution lasting only 3 seconds.  Thirty seconds later the patient reports the mini-aura which she no longer recalled.
Event time 9:58 p.m.  No abnormalities on the EEG were identified at that time.
Event time10:25 a.m.:  There was another burst lasting 4 seconds in duration in the morning on the 20th which is similar to the 2 prior bursts.   No clinical features were recalled.
HR:    60 bpm
INTERVAL IMPRESSION:  There are 3 bursts of rhythmic theta from the left temporal region with frequency evolution.  These are concerning as a potential interictal epileptiform discharge.  They may also be clinically significant with the mini-auras that the patient experienced.
LONG TERM MONITORING - # 12- 72 – 06/20/2012 TO 06/21/2012
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a well defined 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  This is a sleep deprived record.  Around 10:00 p.m. the patient seems to be trying to stay up.  The EEG demonstrates small EPOCHS where the patient seems to be drowsy.   Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K-complexes, and spindles. The data is reviewed for the clinical symptoms that the patient experienced, but no epileptiform features are identified.
HR:    66 bpm
LONG TERM MONITORING - # 12-72 – 06/21/2012 TO 06/22/2012
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient reported an aura at 8 p.m. on the 21st.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Around 8 p.m., the patient is noted to transition in and out of stage 2 sleep, waking up and falling back asleep.  Fragments of deeper stages of sleep are noted overnight.
No electrographic seizures were identified.  The seizure and spike detector did not identify any other epileptiform abnormalities.
Event time 11:55:  The patient pushes the button at 11:56:12 stating that she feels as if she is about to have an aura.  She puts her hand to her chest and later appears to be tearful.  The EEG is awake at this time.  No epileptiform features were noted.   For her 8:00 p.m. the patient reported symptoms that her throat was closing with the seizure.

HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for 3 bursts of rhythmic, paroxysmal theta, all less than 4 seconds in duration, but with frequency evolution.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's clinical symptoms did not appear to be associated with well-defined epileptiform abnormalities.  On one day, however, there were discharges which appear epileptiform in nature.  While this patient did not have any of her larger spells with head turning, a feeling as if her throat was closing or impairment of awareness, this record does not exclude a diagnosis and clinically, diagnosis may be considered.

slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)

Sometimes the patient experienced right arm numbness, head rocking, and right arm shaking.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, pravastatin, metformin, others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the emergency room using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This was an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the alpha rhythm.  The patient transitions in and out of an awake and drowsy state, 14 and 6, 14, and 6 was noted symmetrically in the frontal regions on rare occasions in that transition.

The technologist performed testing for the patient to make sure that the patient was able to be awake and alert.  With cognitive testing, a normal awake EEG pattern was noted.

The patient has an episode of hand tremulousness.  The patient remains awake, alert, conversant with the technologist.  In addition, the EEG pattern during this twitch demonstrates a well organized, well defined normal awake pattern.

Very brief epochs of stage II sleep were recorded.  The patient was not observed to have any involuntary movements in sleep.

At 1:40 p.m. the patient had an episode of head rocking from side to side.  This was not associated with a change in the EEG, although it did produce some tremulousness.

Heart rate:  90 BPM.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab  using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  This EEG was recorded for a patient sitting up in a wheelchair.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well-organized with a 10 Hz, symmetric, alpha rhythm.  The patient starts to drift off to sleep, losing head control.  He is unable to get comfortable in the wheelchair.

Hyperventilation was performed early on in the record not activating the record.  The patient drifts attempts to drift off to sleep with drop out of alpha, central theta and then brief central beta, but deeper stages of sleep are not sustained given the mobility issues.

Photic stimulation did not activate the record.  Heart rate 126 BPM.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Aortic arch bypass surgery.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes during aortic bypass surgery.  The patient was recorded during the entire procedure.  The technician was present during the entire procedure and the physician was present during the critical parts of the procedure.  Feedback was given to the surgeon about changes in the EEG.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  During the procedure the right side of the head is cooled more than the left which may effect the reading of the EEG as was noted during this case.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a baseline posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  Normal frontal central beta seen.  As the procedure goes on, the incision occurs at 9:16 in the morning, heparin is given at 9:31, bypass of the head and body is done at 9:51, aorta clamped at 9:54, cooling starts at 9:56.  During all this time the EEG is at baseline, however, around 9:56 when the cooling begins, there started to be noted some slowing, specifically around 10:01 a.m. in the morning there is an asymmetry where the right side is slightly slower than the left with some sharply contoured activity in the temporal region, that at times becomes periodic and is not clearly seen with a lower amplitude.  This pattern continues as the left hemisphere also starts to become slow, but remains asymmetric up to the time where the EEG starts becomes completely suppressed which occurs first on the right hemisphere, but completely on the entire brain at around 10:13.  At this time there is some burst suppression and by 10:25 it is in complete suppression.  There is cardiac arrest at 10:30 a.m. and he starts to be rewarmed at 10:47 a.m.  He is removed from head bypass at 10:08 a.m. and noticeable bursts of activity start to be seen at around 11:04.  The EEG returns to baseline by 11:21:36 and there is no longer an asymmetry over the right hemisphere.

All the changes that were discussed above were discussed and described to the surgeon.

IMPRESSION:  This is an EEG recording during aortic root replacement surgery with a mild asymmetry noted while cooling, thought to be related to cooling artifact of the right side of the head predominating compared to the left, which after surgery and burst suppression was achieved appeared to return to baseline.  A normal EEG at baseline was seen at the end of the surgery.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 12 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by abundant vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles and POSTS.

Heart rate 78 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in a very sleepy patient.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was attempted in lab standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient has great difficulty cooperating with the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is lacking any of the normal morphologies for an adult of this age.  There is the suggestion of some sharp activity at P4; however, there are so many electrode problems that the EEG is of limited value.  Even the EKG lead did not stay on.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is quite technically limited but is remarkable for paucity of normal wave forms.

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.

No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at intermediate flash rates.

MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Dilantin
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using the standard 10-20 system electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike and seizure detection software was used to review the events, in addition to the patient's alarm events as well as nurses notes.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is relative to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontocentral beta.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness, Stage I, Stage II, Stage III and Stage IV as well as REM sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURE EVENTS:  The patient pressed the button on multiple occasions, at least 4 times, but there appears to be no abnormal behaviors seen on video and at the same time during those episodes on the EEG there was no abnormal discharges.  However, on 04/12/2012, at 9:30 in the morning the patient started complaining of a headache then suddenly started turning her head side to side and then suddenly became stiff with her eyes closed, arched her back and moved towards the side.  She keeps trembling for about 10 to 20 seconds and remains unresponsive.   The patient was questioned and asked to move for a period of about 4 minutes with no response.  Slowly the patient started responding after those 4 minutes.  During the entire episode the patient remains with her eyes closed, and at the end of it she may have some side-to-side movement of the head.  During this whole episode the EEG remains normal and there is no abnormal or epileptiform discharges seen on the EEG.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.  The episode recorded had no EEG correlate.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and sleep EEG.  The episode described above had no EEG correlate and as such it is suggestive of a non-epileptic psychogenic event.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric POSTS, vertex
waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
bilaterally synchronous slow waves.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep 1-hour EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:




This is a normal awake and asleep 1-hour EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

CLINICAL: the patient is lying quietly in bed with eyes closed. She opens her eyes, blinks a few
times, then turns onto her left side and stiffens her body, arching her back. There are some
superimposed irregular jerks.


EEG: there are no EEG changes, other than movement artifact. An awake background with a
sustained posterior dominant rhythm is seen intermittently. There is no postictal attenuation or
asymmetry of background rhythms.


EKG: heart rate increases from baseline 78 bpm to ictal 96 bpm



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 50 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an essentially normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG. An episode of body stiffening with back
arching has no EEG correlate and is most consistent with a nonepileptic behavioral event.

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 29 y.o. male with a history of autism, childhood epilepsy, seizure free for three
years,  referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.


Young man, product of normal L&D but found to have several dysmorphisms in infancy. GMa recalls
renal/ureteral abnormalities, developmental delay, profoundly delayed speech and epilepsy.


Epilepsy controlled for some time but recurred 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2013.

MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

Cholecalciferol, Vitamin D3, (VITAMIN D) 1,000 unit Tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

divalproex (DEPAKOTE ER) 500 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily. Indications:
COMPLEX-PARTIAL EPILEPSY


ibandronate (BONIVA) 150 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth every 30 days. Take one (1) tablet
once per month in the morning with a full glass of water, on an empty stomach.


amLODIPine (NORVASC) 5 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:      Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes
per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.

October 4th to October 5th:  During this section of the record, the patient had 1 clinical event at 11 p.m. on the night of the 4th.
Background:  In sleep, there is abundant beta activity.  No transition in and out of sleep, rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness was noted.  The awake record is well organized with symmetric reactive alpha rhythm.
Interictal epileptiform abnormalities:  None.
Epileptiform seizures:  None.
Event:  11p.m., the patient had been asleep.  She seems to be somewhat drowsy.  Prior to the event, significant noise can be appreciated in the hallway, which has made it difficult to sleep.  By 10:46, there is eye opening noted.  The event is at 11 p.m.  The patient is noted to be breathing heavily, somewhat restless.  The patient pushes the button.  The nurses enter the room.  The patient is breathing heavily.  She is not conversing with the nurses, but she is following commands.  Altered and somewhat peculiar behavior is noted and at 11:02, the patient is crying and moaning.  The patient is consoled by the nurses.  At 11:04, she is responding appropriately to the nurses, but she looks away from them.  The physician enters at 11:06.  Somewhat unusual behavior persists, although there is a great deal of movement artifact, which obscures the EKG.  The overall EEG demonstrates an awake pattern.  At 11:23, she remains tearful with a normal heart rate of 78 beats per minute.
Subsequently, the patient received a tablet of Xanax and transitions back to sleep.
Heart rate 74 bpm.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 53-year-old woman with history of epilepsy since age of 11.  She states that she has 2 types of seizures.  The 1st semiology of seizure starts with an aura of ear buzzing and ear fullness and at times, she has automatism on the right hand, which was described as “searching in the air.” Some seizure episodes were followed by a secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  The patient was on Topamax 25 mg twice a day and Klonopin 1 mg 3 times a day prior to admission to EMU unit.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG monitoring was performed in the EMU using the standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  An automated seizure and spike detection system and a patient activated alarm system were used.  Records were reviewed daily of EEG abnormalities and clinical events.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Interictal EEG:  From 07/02/2013 to 07/03/2013; the interictal posterior dominant rhythm consisted of 9-10 Hz activity that was moderate amount of diffuse beta activity.  Stage I sleep was characterized by disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm and the presence of vertex waves.  Stage II sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and a sleep and slow waves of stage III were also observed. Hyperventilation was performed at 9:20 A.M. by physician, which led to symmetric slowing of background. Photic stimulation was performed at 10:21 A.M. and was followed by no abnormal response or clinical seizures. (Heart rate was between 60-90 per minute and was regular.)
Clinical events: All her clinical events happened during wakefulness.
On 07/03/2013, the patient was sitting at the edge of the bed at 7:40 a.m., was being examined by physician, she reported feeling numbness and tingling in both her hands, she stated that this is one of her typical seizures episodes.  This lasted 2-3 minutes.  At 7:45:21, the patient said she does not feel numbness or tingling any more.  During this episode, the patient was awake and able to answer all questions correctly. The EEG showed an awake pattern with no ictal EEG correlation.
On 07/03/2013 at 6 a.m., the patient was lying in bed. The patient was drowsy.  Then, she woke up.  There was no jerking noted, the patient pushed the alarm button at 6:13 a.m.  EEG showed awake state with no epileptic changes.  The nurse came into the room and checked the blood pressure.
IMPRESSION:  The video EEG monitoring study was normal and did not show electrographic changes consistent with the clinical events.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The interictal EEG does not support the diagnosis of epilepsy.  The episodes are diagnostic for psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.  A simple partial seizure cannot be ruled out by this recording, although complex partial, generalized tonic clonic, and myoclonic seizures can be ruled out.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  We did not capture all the typical seizure types including the generalized tonic-clonic seizures and further long-term monitoring admissions are recommended for capturing the rest of the events.

36 y.o. female with a history of localization related epilepsy referred for routine
EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg iron) tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET TWICE A DAY

Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen 5-300 mg Tablet


Lamictal 200mg BID?

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, hyperventilation and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Brief stage II sleep is captured. Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous
and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes, and POSTS. Slow wave sleep was not
captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding. Patient Falls asleep briefly during photic
stimulation.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72-78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40 uV, 10 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Fast alpha variant is frequent observed. Symmetric 5-15 uV, 18-25 Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. Prominent POSTS are noted. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair effort, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) is performed while patient is asleep and does not produce any effect.

EEG BACKGROUND:
The majority of the study captures sleep.
Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.
During brief periods of arousal, the waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.	Wakefulness is characterized by
a symmetric and reactive posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) of at least 8.5 Hz, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is a technically acceptable record although there is a fair amount of muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm noted reaching 50 mV with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Drowsiness is characterized
by an increase in beta and attenuation of the alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background and a small amount of slowing. Photic stimulation elicited a vigorous driving response.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a routine, 20
minute EEG with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  It is technically satisfactory aside from T1-T2 impedances.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the EEG includes a low-voltage, 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  There is also some muscle artifact noted in the background.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements, but deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation did elicit a driving response.
Heart rate is 72 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG in wakefulness and with minimal drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  A low-voltage record is not a pathological finding.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.

She states that she can't talk or move.  Her eyes are open and she is aware of what is going on.  The spells last 10 minute.  Past history of asthma, dysthymia, DVT, cocaine addiction and diabetes.
MEDICATIONS:  Lasix, Flonase, Proventil, HydroDIURIL, insulin, Neurontin, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  This was a routine 20 minute outpatient EEG.  It is technically satisfactory, although there was a fair amount of muscle and movement artifact noted.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  In wakefulness, there is a fair amount of chew artifact.  Lambda was noted.
As the patient drifts off to sleep there is an increase in beta.  There is the appearance of posteriorly predominant slowing as well as electrocardiogram artifact and as the patient becomes drowsy there is a bit more head rocking, but a suggestion of slowing in the right occipital region relative to the left.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
HEART RATE 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is likely within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  There were no major abnormalities and the asymmetry noted in the occipital regions may represent head rocking artifact as the patient drifts off to sleep.  If additional information is needed, a more prolonged sleep EEG may be of value.  In addition, if this patient is thought to have sleep paralysis, a formal sleep study may be helpful.  Alternatively, consider a 1 hour EEG in the lab with a muscle monitor to look for evidence of reduced muscle tone in states other REM sleep.

symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Patient transitions to sleep very rapidly and is asleep
throughout most of the recording.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2, extensive
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 26-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and mostly asleep. Patient transitions to sleep
very rapidly and is asleep throughout most of the recording - please correlate clinically with an
underlying sleep disorder.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel  EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a technically satisfactory EEG, although impedance in the T1-T2 electrodes are just above 5 kilohms.  There are no previous EEGs available for comparison.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Scant theta is noted in the background.  The patient is very drowsy with transitions in and out of stage 1 sleep with slow rolling eye movements.
In drowsiness, there are a handful of bursts of shifting slowing as well as a synchronous eye artifact.
Hyperventilation produces a small increase in theta.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting off to sleep, but did elicit a driving response.
Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is at the limits of normal for an adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No sharp waves or spikes were noted in this record.  This patient demonstrates a great deal of eye artifact, but no definitive epileptiform features.  This seems to be a very drowsy individual.  To more completely characterize this patient's epilepsy, a followup study capturing more extensive sleep may be obtained.  The eye artifact described above is not a pathological finding.

and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:








The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During very brief periods of drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant
rhythm is seen.



Sleep is not captured

TECHNIQUE:


A 1 hour   Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. POSTS are noted. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5-10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.

sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing and several bursts of diffuse theta and delta activity.  Stepped photic
stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Patient sweats
profoundly throughout the recording. This affects the quality of EEG leads.

alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further
to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Please
note that some spindles at times become very prominent in the frontal regions.

MEDICATIONS: carBAMazepine (TEGRETOL) 200 mg tablet, Take 200 mg by mouth 2 times daily.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep 1-hour EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:




This is a normal awake and asleep 1-hour EEG.

A normal EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS:  Simvastatin, lisinopril, and Zocor.
INTRODUCTION:  Routine digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  This is a technically acceptable routine EEG with impedances under 20 kilos with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is occasional, shifting right or left temporal theta or delta.  Deeper stages of sleep include vertex waves.  K complexes were noted in stage 2 sleep.
In maximal wakefulness, the EEG is unremarkable for age.
Photic stimulation was performed as the patient was drifting off to sleep.  Scant driving response was noted.
Heart rate irregular 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits for age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  A subject of this age is permitted a small amount of theta-delta in the transition to sleep. This is similar to the patient’s recent (also normal) EEG

MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Benadryl.
INTRODUCTION:  Routine 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a technically acceptable record with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes, which did not have the appropriate impedances.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the alpha rhythm with rhythmic central theta.  Vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS were noted in stage 2 sleep.
Hyperventilation produces a small increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting into stage 2 sleep, but scant driving response was noted.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration, a followup tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.

TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. In addition during HV there is a rhythmic theta in the
right anterior temporal region. Later in post HV this theta returns and appears to increase in
amplitude slightly and decrease in frequency. The patient can answer a simple question during it.





Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  Single right temporal discharge of unclear
significance.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG. The pattern described above is of unclear clinical
significance but the possible evolution raises the concern for a potentially epileptogenic discharge.
Repeat prolonged EEG and testing may aid in clarifying the underlying nature of the discharge.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm of 40 microvolts.  The waking record includes a great deal of muscle artifact.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta with slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 106 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
Clinical Correlation:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  Previous EEGs are not available at this time.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study capturing deeper stages of sleep may be of value.  Of note, the patient demonstrates tachycardia.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.

INTRODUCTION:  One hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a technically acceptable record with impedances under 5 kilohms for most electrodes.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 11 hertz, 80 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm.  Posterior slow waves of youth were noted.  Patient appears to have been sleep deprived and rapidly transitions in and out of stage 2 sleep.
Photic stimulation:  The patient was in stage 2 sleep during photic stimulation.  Despite this, a driving response was noted at 15 hertz.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  This was the 3rd normal EEG for this adult.  It did capture extensive stage 2 sleep.  If this individual continues to have frequent seizures, alternative techniques to capture epileptiform activity or a seizure may be considered.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness there is a 9  Hz alpha rhythm.  In drowsiness, there is an increase in background slowing with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles noted in stage 2 sleep.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting into stage 2 sleep and did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate:  78  bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and EEG monitoring will follow for this adult.

HISTORY:  41 years old woman with episodes headache, dizziness and then LOC.
INTRODUCTION:  24-hour continuous video EEG monitoring was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG and seizure and spike detection software.
DATE OF STUDY:  06/22/15 to 06/23/15.
No seizures were noted by the patient, software or nursing team.  The patient reported symptoms of chronic pain and had frequent requests for pain medicine.  Typical seizures are characterized by occipital headache or dizziness and/or visual changes.
Background:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing.  Stage 2 sleep was characterized by vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  Sleep was disrupted and the patient was awake significantly during the night.
Epileptiform Detections: None
Seizures: None
Heart rate:  84 bpm.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This 1st 24 hours of continuous video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:

Background:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing.  Stage 2 sleep was characterized by vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.
Epileptiform Detections: None
Seizures: None
Heart rate:  84 bpm
Event at 4:04 PM: Patient was off camera for this 112 sec episode of stiffening followed by 5 min unresponsiveness after which patient then  got up and out of bed. The EEG during this event demonstrated muscle artifact during the stiffening. After the patient was placed in bed, there was a great deal of motor artifact. The patient demonstrated self protective movements at that time. The bedside physician tapped on the scalp electrodes and the EEG returned to a normal awake pattern.
IMPRESSION/ This 2 day  continuous video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
Normal background.
Absence of epileptiform activity
Single event without EEG change and with purposeful, protective movements and no post ictal EEG changes, suggestive of Non epileptic seizure
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings were reviewed with the patient who chose to terminate EEG recording the morning after the 06/23 event. The event recorded was initially off camera and differs behaviorally from the spells reported by the patient on admission.   The patient attributed the event above to “stress” .No evidence of epilepsy was found.

Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11-11.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha
rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect,

MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  41-minute, digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with appropriate impedances.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  Sleep was achieved.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 11 hertz, 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm, which was symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Lateral rectus eye movement artifact was noted.  Drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements with rhythmic central theta, and POSTS.  Brief stage 2 sleep included spindles.  Sleep was sustained during the EEG.
Hyperventilation was performed with good effort and did not significantly activate the record.  The patient was falling asleep during photic stimulation, but a vigorous driving response was achieved.
Heart rate 55 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted in this EEG.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy, but for an individual with significant nocturnal convulsions, a followup study with more sustained sleep or even an overnight study may be informative.

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5-11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.  Regular heart rate is noted on a single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information. Regular heart rate is noted on a single EKG lead.

INTRODUCTION:  A 24-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in backup theta followed by posts, vertex waves, K complexes were noted in stage 2 sleep.  Abundant stage 2 sleep was noted with frequent transitions in and out of stage 2 sleep.
Hyperventilation elicits an increase in higher amplitude rhythmic sign.  Photic stimulation is performed, although the patient is drifting off to sleep and elicits scant driving.
Heart rate:  60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features are identified in sleep.  If additional information is needed, a more prolonged study when the patient is experiencing, her typical symptoms may be of value.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:





INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patient's interictal findings were insignificant with normal EEG with 9
Hz posterior dominant rhythm,  without any focal findings  or epileptiform discharges.




ICTAL FINDINGS:

The patient did not have any clinical events.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. pseudoseizure



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 4 days with continuous video EEG  (3
days 95951).  This was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of symptoms.



The interictal EEG is characterized by  A normal, posterior dominant rhythm.



The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of heradmission.No other medication changes
were made during the hospitalization.



We recommend she continue to see a psychiatrist.  She and her wife are happy to do so.  With
careful review of the symptoms, the family feels that most of the symptoms have been due to
overmedication and that the patient was much improved by medication reduction.  Therefore,
neither patient nor family was eager to prolonged hospitalization or tried to elicit a nonepileptic
seizure.  The family was encouraged to speak up with practitioners to avoid overmedication.  The
patient demonstrated an understanding of the pre-existing diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures





Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:





INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patient's interictal findings were insignificant with normal EEG with 9
Hz posterior dominant rhythm,  without any focal findings  or epileptiform discharges.




ICTAL FINDINGS:

The patient did not have any clinical events.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. pseudoseizure



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 4 days with continuous video EEG  (3
days 95951).  This was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of symptoms.



The interictal EEG is characterized by  A normal, posterior dominant rhythm.



The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of heradmission.No other medication changes
were made during the hospitalization.



We recommend she continue to see a psychiatrist.  She and her wife are happy to do so.  With
careful review of the symptoms, the family feels that most of the symptoms have been due to
overmedication and that the patient was much improved by medication reduction.  Therefore,
neither patient nor family was eager to prolonged hospitalization or tried to elicit a nonepileptic
seizure.  The family was encouraged to speak up with practitioners to avoid overmedication.  The
patient demonstrated an understanding of the pre-existing diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures





Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:





INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patient's interictal findings were insignificant with normal EEG with 9
Hz posterior dominant rhythm,  without any focal findings  or epileptiform discharges.




ICTAL FINDINGS:

The patient did not have any clinical events.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. pseudoseizure



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 4 days with continuous video EEG  (3
days 95951).  This was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of symptoms.



The interictal EEG is characterized by  A normal, posterior dominant rhythm.



The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of heradmission.No other medication changes
were made during the hospitalization.



We recommend she continue to see a psychiatrist.  She and her wife are happy to do so.  With
careful review of the symptoms, the family feels that most of the symptoms have been due to
overmedication and that the patient was much improved by medication reduction.  Therefore,
neither patient nor family was eager to prolonged hospitalization or tried to elicit a nonepileptic
seizure.  The family was encouraged to speak up with practitioners to avoid overmedication.  The
patient demonstrated an understanding of the pre-existing diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures





Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.

EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.






Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  The family was
interviewed.  Some of their concerns were slurred speech which was not a paroxysmal finding but an
ongoing every day symptom.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 92 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal day 1 24 hour  routine EMU EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal video LTM routine EEG.

chlorproMAZINE (THORAZINE) 50 mg tablet, Take 50 mg by mouth 3 times daily.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.






Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  The family was
interviewed.  Some of their concerns were slurred speech which was not a paroxysmal finding but an
ongoing every day symptom.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 92 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal day 1 24 hour  routine EMU EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal video LTM routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:





INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patient's interictal findings were insignificant with normal EEG with 9
Hz posterior dominant rhythm,  without any focal findings  or epileptiform discharges.




ICTAL FINDINGS:

The patient did not have any clinical events.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. pseudoseizure



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 4 days with continuous video EEG  (3
days 95951).  This was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of symptoms.



The interictal EEG is characterized by  A normal, posterior dominant rhythm.



The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of heradmission.No other medication changes
were made during the hospitalization.



We recommend she continue to see a psychiatrist.  She and her wife are happy to do so.  With
careful review of the symptoms, the family feels that most of the symptoms have been due to
overmedication and that the patient was much improved by medication reduction.  Therefore,
neither patient nor family was eager to prolonged hospitalization or tried to elicit a nonepileptic
seizure.  The family was encouraged to speak up with practitioners to avoid overmedication.  The
patient demonstrated an understanding of the pre-existing diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures





Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.

chlorproMAZINE (THORAZINE) 50 mg tablet, Take 50 mg by mouth 3 times daily.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.






Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  The family was
interviewed.  Some of their concerns were slurred speech which was not a paroxysmal finding but an
ongoing every day symptom.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 92 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal day 1 24 hour  routine EMU EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal video LTM routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:





INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patient's interictal findings were insignificant with normal EEG with 9
Hz posterior dominant rhythm,  without any focal findings  or epileptiform discharges.




ICTAL FINDINGS:

The patient did not have any clinical events.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. pseudoseizure



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 4 days with continuous video EEG  (3
days 95951).  This was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of symptoms.



The interictal EEG is characterized by  A normal, posterior dominant rhythm.



The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of heradmission.No other medication changes
were made during the hospitalization.



We recommend she continue to see a psychiatrist.  She and her wife are happy to do so.  With
careful review of the symptoms, the family feels that most of the symptoms have been due to
overmedication and that the patient was much improved by medication reduction.  Therefore,
neither patient nor family was eager to prolonged hospitalization or tried to elicit a nonepileptic
seizure.  The family was encouraged to speak up with practitioners to avoid overmedication.  The
patient demonstrated an understanding of the pre-existing diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures





Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.

aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, Take 81 mg by mouth daily.


chlorproMAZINE (THORAZINE) 50 mg tablet, Take 50 mg by mouth 3 times daily.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.






Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  The family was
interviewed.  Some of their concerns were slurred speech which was not a paroxysmal finding but an
ongoing every day symptom.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 92 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal day 1 24 hour  routine EMU EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal video LTM routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



There are some slightly asymmetric EOMS.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep includes vertex waves and spindles. There are EOMS in sleep.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:





INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patient's interictal findings were insignificant with normal EEG with 9
Hz posterior dominant rhythm,  without any focal findings  or epileptiform discharges.




ICTAL FINDINGS:

The patient did not have any clinical events.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. pseudoseizure



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 4 days with continuous video EEG  (3
days 95951).  This was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of symptoms.



The interictal EEG is characterized by  A normal, posterior dominant rhythm.



The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of heradmission.No other medication changes
were made during the hospitalization.



We recommend she continue to see a psychiatrist.  She and her wife are happy to do so.  With
careful review of the symptoms, the family feels that most of the symptoms have been due to
overmedication and that the patient was much improved by medication reduction.  Therefore,
neither patient nor family was eager to prolonged hospitalization or tried to elicit a nonepileptic
seizure.  The family was encouraged to speak up with practitioners to avoid overmedication.  The
patient demonstrated an understanding of the pre-existing diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures





Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.

EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



There are some slightly asymmetric EOMS.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:





INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patient's interictal findings were insignificant with normal EEG with 9
Hz posterior dominant rhythm,  without any focal findings  or epileptiform discharges.




ICTAL FINDINGS:

The patient did not have any clinical events.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. pseudoseizure



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 4 days with continuous video EEG  (3
days 95951).  This was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of symptoms.



The interictal EEG is characterized by  A normal, posterior dominant rhythm.



The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of heradmission.No other medication changes
were made during the hospitalization.



We recommend she continue to see a psychiatrist.  She and her wife are happy to do so.  With
careful review of the symptoms, the family feels that most of the symptoms have been due to
overmedication and that the patient was much improved by medication reduction.  Therefore,
neither patient nor family was eager to prolonged hospitalization or tried to elicit a nonepileptic
seizure.  The family was encouraged to speak up with practitioners to avoid overmedication.  The
patient demonstrated an understanding of the pre-existing diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures





Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.

INTRODUCTION:  A 40-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This adult had difficulty cooperating with testing.  Impedances were challenging and muscle artifact was difficult to eliminate.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a well organized pattern with generous beta.  An 11 Hz alpha rhythm was noted with generous, low voltage, frontal central beta.  In relaxed wakefulness and early drowsiness, a 5.6 hertz rhythmic, mid temporal theta was noted.  This may be identified unilaterally or bilaterally with most burst of 5-7 seconds in duration, some somewhat longer.
No slowing was noted following these bursts of 5.6 second activity.  The technologist was not able to test the patient during the bursts.  Afterwards, no impairment of awareness was noted.
Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta with attenuation of the alpha rhythm, but deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.
Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta and may accentuate the 5.6 hertz activity.  Despite the muscle artifact, photic driving response was noted.
Heart rate 66 to 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging, but EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This theta described above as the characteristics of a normal variant.  This EEG was remarkable for a significant amount of muscle artifact as well as the failure to perform testing during the discharges.

Background:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements with POSTS.  The patient was relatively drowsy.  Stage 2 sleep included spindles. Recording was discontinued at 4:51 PM by the patient.
Event: 12:10:49 PM  The patient was awake.  Her partner was in the room.  She had an episode of speech arrest with head turning away from the clinicians. EEG demonstrated an awake pattern. No epileptiform features were noted.  After the partner left, the patient was noted to cry and then drifted off to sleep by 12:37.
Seizures: none
Epileptiform Activity: none
Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal 6-hour EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the 4th normal EEG for this adult.  No epileptiform features were noted.  At least 1 clinical event was captured, although it was not seizure with motor activity.  This individual is thought to have epilepsy, alternative management strategies may be considered.

system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HVand photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz , 60 uV posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.

Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for ~18 hours from 11/11/2014 to 11/12/2014.
Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was
reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG
patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
The Gotman spike and seizure detection algorithm (Stellate) was used to screen the EEG in real
time for electrographic seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges.

then LOC. referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.




MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions: cyclobenzaprine (FLEXERIL) 5 mg tablet,  naproxen (NAPROSYN)
500 mg tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth 2 times daily (with meals).



TECHNIQUE:

A  1 hour sleep deprived Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using
the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  This is followed by prominent, rhythmic
central theta and then POSTS.

sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  Abundant stage II sleep was
note

No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Hyperventilation: Produces a small amount of rhythmic background slowing

Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.  The driving response was elicited, despite the
fact that the patient was falling asleep




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE: A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal 1 hour sleep deprived awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or
electrographic events reported or detected.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine 21-channel EEG was performed utilizing the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement along with hyperventilation, photic stimulation, EKG, and EOG monitoring.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The awake resting background reveals a moderate amount of 15-20 microvolt, 9-10 Hz rhythmic activity posteriorly.  A large amount of muscle artifact and generalized low voltage 20-30 Hz beta-activity was seen.  Prominent eye blink artifact was also noted.  With drowsiness, there was initial slowing followed by attenuation of posterior rhythmic activity and increasing frontocentral low to medium amplitude makes frequent theta activity.  Brief stage 2 sleep was seen with further attenuation of muscle artifact and beta and vertex waves along with very brief central sleep spindle activity.  Hyperventilation produced no significant activation of record.  Photic stimulation added no additional information.  EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm at 69 per minute with ST-T wave abnormalities.

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring continues for 22-year-old male with staring spells.  The patient had multiple push buttons for staring spells during this 24-hour section.
Background:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Abundant stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  Of note, sleep was relatively disrupted on the 1st day, but the patient seemed to be having more extensive stage 2 sleep early in the morning on the 24th.  In stage 2 sleep, occasional beta spindles were noted.  REM sleep was noted during multiple sections of the overnight recording with multiple spontaneous brief arousals from REM sleep.  There may have been some snore artifact noted at other times, but the arousals from REM sleep were not associated with epileptiform activity or significant snoring that could be detected by the recording strategy employed.
Epileptiform seizures:  None.
Pushbuttons:  On the 24th, there were 17 push button events.  Two of these were practice pushbuttons.  These events span primarily around 12:19 p.m., but standard time from 12:07 p.m. until 1:57 p.m., and then again 3:31, 4:32, and 7:18:45.  The patient is communicative and conversing with the nurse during the blinking spells.  He is awake during all of them.  After sometime, the nursing staff does not enter for every spell, but the patient can be seen clearly involved and engaged in activities and in some cases talking on the phone.  No epileptiform features were identified with the push buttons.  The EEG consistently demonstrates a normal awake pattern, although he does have some increase in heart rate.  For the 1:57 p.m. event, the patient does demonstrate a clear change in heart rate with a somewhat irregular heart rate at the end.
Epileptiform Detections:  Rare epileptiform detections were noted exclusively in sleep in this section of the record.  They are primarily seen in stage 2 sleep and include frontally predominant 2.5 to 4 Hz spike and wave activity as well as a isolated spike and wave activity.  With review using an average reference, some of the isolated spikes demonstrate a maximum between FC and F3.
Heart rate 60 to 90 to 130 BPM bpm
IMPRESSION:  This 48 hour EEG monitoring session was remarkable for:
An interictal EEG, which demonstrates spike and wave and slow spike and wave activity, at this time, exclusively in sleep, similar to the previous EEG monitoring from 2006 to 2010.
Some spike and wave activity demonstrates L FC maximum.
Multiple episodes of blinking, involuntary blinking noted and wakefulness.  No EEG change noted. Patient is awake and alert for all
On rare occasions, an irregular heart rate.
Disrupted sleep with multiple arousals from REM sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted in association with the patient staring and blinking.  The irregular heart rate was also noted without clinical symptoms and referral for Cardiology consultation may be considered.

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.  At
the beginning of the records there is excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present.
This improves over time.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  The record commences with the
patient having an episode of irregular arm and body shaking with occasional back arching and
closed eyes. This shaking intermittently worsens in severity and then improves. The event lasts for
about 10 minutes.  There is no EEG correlate to the event.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The episode captured above had no EEG

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient was intubated and poorly responsive throughout the monitoring session.
April 10th to April 11th:
This section of the EEG begins after the patient has been treated for status epilepticus and was intubated and unresponsive.  The first 24 hours of the record demonstrate diffusely slow pattern with mixed theta delta and occasional arousals with muscle artifact  Some sections of the record demonstrate a bit more arrhythmic theta than the others.
There is a bit more theta noted on the morning of April 11, 2015.
Electrographic seizures:  None.
Clinical events:  None.
Epileptiform Detections:  None significant.
April 11, 2015 to April 12, 2015:
Medications, norepinephrine, vancomycin, piperacillin, phenytoin, warfarin, methimazole, Ativan, and others.
Introduction:  EEG monitoring continues.  No clinical seizures were noted.
Background:  The background demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern with more of a pattern of theta and delta.  Occasional spontaneous arousals were noted.
On the 12th, there were some sections of the record noted with more rhythmic, higher amplitude delta.
There are also some triphasic waves noted.
Seizures:  None.
Epileptiform Detections:  There are some subtly defined midline vertex sharp waves noted.  These differ from normal sleep morphologies.  They do not evolve, but during some sections of the record, they are somewhat more prominent than others.
Heart rate: irregular, 60 to 90 bpm.
April 12, 2015 to April 13, 2015:  During this section of the record, no clinical seizures were noted.  The patient remained intubated and unresponsive.
Medications, norepinephrine, vancomycin, piperacillin, phenytoin, warfarin, methimazole,
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG continued to demonstrate a markedly slow pattern.  Intermittent rhythmic delta activity was noted as were triphasic waves.  Occasional spontaneous arousals were noted.
Electrographic seizures:  None.
Interictal sharp waves or spikes:  Vertex sharp waves can be identified using various montages.  There is a higher amplitude sharp wave  maximum at FZ.  In some sections of the record, it is more prominent than others.
Heart rate:  irregular, 70 to 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This 72-hour continuous video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for,
Markedly slow background with intermittent arousals.
Absence of normal waveforms, awake and asleep.
An emerging F7 sharp wave noted, which was monitored for an extended period of time, which did not evolve into clinical or electrographic seizures.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings were discussed with the clinical team.  The emerging sharp wave noted at FZ is thought to correlate with a metastasis in that same region in this individual with multiple cerebral metastases.  No electrographic or clinical seizures were recorded throughout the patient's prolonged recording.

I NTRODUCTION: A 22-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed, but hyperventilation was deferred.  This is a technically acceptable record with most impedances below 5 kilohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9.5 hertz, 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background theta followed by POSTs and spindles in stage 2 sleep. Snore artifact was sometimes noted. Nor may also have disrupted the patient's sleep.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient had been in stage 2 sleep and minimal activates the record.
Heart rate: 66 bpm.

MEDICATIONS: Advair, Tylenol.
INTRODUCTION: A 26-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a technically acceptable EEG with most impedances below 5 kilohms.  Notation is made for what appears to be a slight error and had a measurement in the frontal electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is 9.6 hertz, 40 microvolt, posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  POSTS were noted in stage 1 sleep and very brief stage 2 sleep included K complexes and vertex waves.  Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing in the background. Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate: 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged study or study capturing one of the patient's staring spells is suggested.

INTRODUCTION: One-hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Mu activity was identified, but testing was not performed to confirm this. There is a small amount of underlying theta in the posterior regions bilaterally. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and an increase in beta as well as attenuation of the alpha rhythm. Rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness appears in the transition in and out of sleep. Stage 2 sleep was characterized by spindles. There may be underlying snore arousals. Hyperventilation produced an increase in theta.
Photic stimulation was performed as the patient was falling asleep. There was a photic driving response noted.  In addition, rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness with a characteristic 5 Hz activity was noted during photic stimulation.
Heart rate 60 to 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and a brief stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness is a normal variant.  No definitive epileptiform features were noted.  The patient appears to be quite drowsy with frequent arousals and snoring. Clinical evaluation may be of value.

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is captured.  During drowsiness, the

to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with poor cooperation, and produces no effect.  
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.

times daily.




No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:




A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and


photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.5

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.

TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a   technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any sustained photic driving or other EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

evaluation of paroxysmal events: he has now had 2 episodes of LOC in setting of vagal activity, with
subsequent right hemiparesis.




MEDICATIONS: midazolam, famotidine



SEDATION: meds as above



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically difficult record;
tech noted that she could not get impedances <5 kOhm despite best efforts, and there was frequent
artifact affecting the O1 and O2 leads. The study included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The study consists of mostly sleep.



During brief periods of wakefulness, the background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of mostly low
voltage fast frequencies, which attenuate symmetrically with eye opening. Posterior dominant rhythm
consists of low voltage fast frequencies.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal, albeit technically limited, awake and mostly asleep/drowsy routine EEG.  There are
no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected. A background consisting of low voltage fast
frequencies can be normal variant in the adult population.

EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic

Description:
	
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. Diffuse excess beta activity is captured. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges Sleep, stage 2
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 27-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.

	Hyperventilation is not perform since patient is having breathing difficulties.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake, 
	drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-9.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal 
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric 
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Patient very rapidly transitions from wakefulness to stage 
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) 
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
	No epileptiform discharges
	Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 23-minute EEG, awake, and mostly asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges 
on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Rapid transions from 
wakefulness to stage II sleep are suggestive of an excessively drowsy patient versus an underlying 
sleep disorder - please correlate clinically.

TECHNIQUE:

A  Bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and vocal stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE: A heart rate of 98 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION: This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or
electrographic events reported or detected.






CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
