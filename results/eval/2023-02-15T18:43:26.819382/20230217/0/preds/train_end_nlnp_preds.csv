INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow and poorly organized with a low voltage delta and theta frequency activity. This pattern is seen when the patient is awake or stuporous.  The patient is observed by a nurse and tech and there is IV or other drip.  There was an unusual, somewhat periodic complex identified in the background with an unusual field of spread and phase reversal.  In specific montages including a referential ear montage, the activity is clearly maximum on the right but with spread to the left and in some montages which accentuate P4, it is possible to identify a P4 phase reversal.  The activity is usually unilateral but sometimes bilateral and sometimes seems to be asynchronous on the other side.  Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity, as well as brief arousals.
The unusual, periodic activity in this record can be clearly differentiated from EKG artifact and there is no identifiable other source of artifact for this individual.
HR:  104 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Periodic activity poorly localized but probably maximum in the right parietal region, although sometimes generalized.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing differs from previous studies and suggests a process in the parietal regions, which may be epileptiform in nature.  No seizures were recorded.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the Pediatric Unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is awake in a supported wheelchair. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the child is awake.  The background EEG demonstrates a relatively low voltage, theta and/or delta pattern in the frontocentral regions.  From the occipital regions, there is somewhat irregular 2 to 4 Hz activity, which is high amplitude. Sometimes with this activity, there is an occipital sharp wave. In addition, in wakefulness, there is a central, high amplitude spike and slow wave complex which is maximum at C3/CZ. This has a relatively generous field of spread, but in appropriate montages it clearly seems to be maximum from the left.  Despite the shunt, there is no significant breech on the right.
HR:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a child of this age due to:
Nearly continuous occipitally predominant delta activity with right greater than left occipital sharp and slow wave complexes or spike and slow wave complexes.
High amplitude left central or midline spike and slow wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a bihemispheric process effecting both gray and white matter. In addition, epileptiform activity was seen in more than one region, but supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy if this child’s behaviors are thought to be seizures.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is continuous, low voltage and includes low voltage diffuse rhythmic theta and delta.  The primary frequencies in the background are 3 to 5 Hz, but there is some faster and some slower frequency activity.  Stimulation of the patient produces some rhythmic artifact, as well as attenuation of the EEG, but no clear arousal. In the initial portions of the record, there is little variability in the record, however, as the recording continues, there is an increase in  beta frequency activity, as well as some evidence of spontaneous variability and reactivity.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: With the poor reactivity and variability identified in the initial portions of the record but an improvement towards the close of the record, a dynamic process such as a metabolic or toxic encephalopathy or even postictal state may contribute to this pattern. No epileptiform features were seen and no seizures were recorded.

There does not appear to be an underlying epileptiform correlate with the movements, however.  As the EEG continues, approximately six minutes into the EEG, the movements decrease and the EEG pattern is one of diffuse background slowing with poor organization and a mixture of rhythmic delta and theta frequency activity.  There are occasional shifting asymmetries and occasionally there is higher amplitude frontally predominant delta in one hemisphere or the other.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. It was felt that the patient was hyperventilating throughout the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the EEG begins, the patient is awake in a noisy bedside environment with a number of background conversations that appear not to be related to him or his care.  He is markedly tachypneic. The background EEG demonstrates an awake pattern with an 8.5 Hz, 30 to 50 V posterior dominant rhythm in a background with generous amounts of beta activity.  There is a fair amount of movement artifact, but there is no definite background slowing. Photic stimulation elicits driving at intermediate and faster flash frequencies.
HR:  140 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The clinical team was contacted regarding the tachypnea and tachycardia.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is described as intubated and “tense.”
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. Portions of the record show dramatic suppression from the left in an overall low voltage pattern.  The frequencies from the right include delta and theta frequency activity and there are rare right temporal sharp waves identified in the background.  While some portions of the record are partly compromised by a 60 Hz artifact, as the recording continues, the overall pattern remains extremely low voltage.  Stimulation of the patient does not produce a change in the background. Of note, at the close of the record, the EEG is approximately at baseline in terms of the very low voltage pattern with a degree of suppression seen from each hemisphere.
HR:  __ BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent, sometimes marked suppression from the left hemisphere.
Low voltage, generalized slow pattern from the right with occasional temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: To some extent, the dynamic features described above may be an artifact. Given the overall low voltage record and the challenges of recording in an ICU with the appearance of 60 Hz, some of the deterioration in the pattern may be an artifact. This tracing supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function effecting the left hemisphere more than the right, as well as potentially a partial mechanism for seizures on the right.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is described as obtunded, lethargic, or asleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: When the patient is resting quietly, the background is very low voltage with low voltage theta frequency activity of 5 to 7 Hz, which sometimes is more prominent in the anterior regions, and low amplitude 0.5 to 3 Hz delta activity which sometimes demonstrates shifting asymmetries.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is medium to low amplitude and is comprised of a pattern that is a mixture of rhythmic 4 to 6 Hz theta frequency activity, which occurs in bursts with slower underlying low voltage delta activity in a somewhat discontinuous or paroxysmal pattern. The theta activity is most prominent in the frontal regions where it is sometimes higher amplitude and more sharply contoured and may reach a frequency of 7 to 8 Hz, with a 7 to 8 Hz discharge among the theta frequency activity.  Stimulation of the patient does not significantly activate the record.
HR:  142 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a pattern of rhythmic theta, smaller amounts of delta, and subtle discontinuity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are non-specific, but support a diffuse disorder of cerebral function.  The pattern would be typical of that of pharmacologic coma. No definite focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record. If additional information is required, a repeat tracing after this patient’s sedative, hypnotic medications have worn off may be of use.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the or at the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage and rich in beta frequency activity.  There is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm identified from the right occipital region.  The primary pattern is a drowsy pattern, but in drowsiness there is sharply contoured theta frequency activity maximum at F7.  In addition, there seems to be a slight variability and at times there is a bit more theta frequency in the right frontal region compared to the left, although the central regions are symmetric.  As the patient continues in a relatively drowsy state, there is persistent rhythmic theta identified from the left frontotemporal region with left frontal sharp and slow wave complexes.  These are discrete and are best identified with a sensitivity of 5.  They can be identified both in the montages which accentuate temporal abnormalities, as well as referential montages. Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is noted to have left arm twitching on one occasion.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is in a burst suppression pattern.  Numbers of high amplitude, sharply contoured theta and faster frequency activity are identified relatively symmetrically from the frontal regions.  The suppression in the background is quite variable ranging with as many as one to three second bursts in 15 seconds to last. There are also portions where it attenuates rather than actually suppresses.  There is variability and in some portions, the right hemisphere is much more suppressed and is flatter longer than the left.  In other portions of the record, there may be a bit more theta on either the left or the right.
Stimulation of the patient does not significantly activate the record.  Jerking movements are difficult to identify in this video.  There is no clear change with the jerking during the EEG given the overall variability in the pattern described above.
HR:  __ BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Burst suppression pattern.
Intermittent shifting asymmetries sometimes with more significant suppression on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a severe disorder of cerebral function effecting both hemispheres.  There is evidence in this record to suggest that the right hemisphere may be more effected than the left.  In the absence of hypothermia or very high dose sedative hypnotic drugs, this tracing would be most supportive of a severe anoxic encephalopathy, although this may also represent a traumatic pattern.  The prognosis for this pattern is considered poor if durations of time since the cardiac arrest is greater than 24 hours.  Of note, on the few occasions that the patient did experience jerking, there was clear muscle artifact in the EEG suggesting that subtle twitching wasn’t a major clinical factor.

INTRODUCTION: Portable digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake through drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates intra-hemispheric asymmetry and diffuse slowing.  The alpha rhythm is slow with 6 to 7 Hz, 20 V activity in maximal wakefulness.  There is continuous left hemispheric rhythmic delta activity of 90 V and left temporal breech activity is seen.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and decreased amplitude of the background.  Occasionally, sharp activity was seen in the T3 region in drowsiness. Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the ER using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is drowsy.  The background EEG is primarily theta.  There is some temporal wicket activity.  There are intermittent bursts of sharply contoured irregular, higher amplitude theta frequency activity with bursts typically lasting under three seconds in duration.  Most of them last under one second.  Some of these have an underlying spike and slow wave complex seen in association with them.  In addition, unfortunately this is also the region where the patient has EKG artifact and an irregular heart rate.  The bursts of irregular temporal theta have a left mid-to-anterior temporal underlying spike and slow wave or sharp and slow wave complex.  On occasion, that epileptiform activity isn’t seen in the posterior rather than the anterior temporal region.  In addition, there is a bilateral distribution of the regular theta.
Stimulation of the patient elicits an alerting with a very brief posterior dominant rhythm, which is approximately 7 to 8 Hz.
HR:  96 BPM, irregular.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Irregular, sharply contoured bursts of theta activity with an underlying sharp wave from the left temporal region with variable maximum and occasional bitemporal involvement.
Generalized background slowing.
Irregular heart rate.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is sedated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial portions of the record are low voltage beta with superimposed significant muscle activity.  As the recording continues, the patient becomes less tense and a low voltage beta pattern is identified with symmetric underlying low voltage delta.  Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting with an increase in muscle, as well as the brief appearance of some alpha frequency activity.  There is variability in the record and there are portions of the record where there is lower voltage symmetric theta and delta.  The tech notes that the patient occasionally tenses his hands or bites on his endotracheal tube, again producing an increase in muscle and beta activity.  In later portions of the record, as the patient appears to relax, there is lower voltage, slow delta seen.
HR:  102 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with beta frequency pattern.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Some of the features described above are compatible with a pharmacologic coma.  The spontaneous reactivity and variability are positive prognostic signs even in the setting of sedation.  With relaxation, we see a diffuse pattern of delta supporting a diffuse disorder of cerebral function and contributing factors may include the CNS processes described above or the medications.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely slow and disorganized with rhythmic slowing of 4 to 5 Hz. Normal posterior alpha rhythm is not seen.  A small amount of low voltage beta activity is seen in the frontal and central regions.  Occasionally, writhing and jerky movements were seen on the digital video camera, but no EEG changes were recorded.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing demonstrates an diffuse slowing, which is non-specific.  The generalized diffuse slowing in the disorganized background is consistent with cerebral dysfunction such as AlzheimerÕs disease, dementing illnesses or other forms of encephalopathy.  The sharp waves can also be seen in patients with AlzheimerÕs disease or dementia.   Multiple writhing movements were observed on the video camera, but with no EEG correlate.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is awake and cooperative throughout the record.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive.  There is subtle, intermittent focal slowing identified from the left frontal temporal region.  At times this includes rhythmic activity of 3 to 5 Hz.  On other occasions, there seems to be intermittent disruption of faster frequency activity in this region.  In relaxed wakefulness and early drowsiness, there are occasional sharp waves identified maximum at FP1 or occasionally isoelectric at FP1/F3.  On occasion, these may be maximum in the left anterior temporal electrode.
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and subtly accentuates some of the focal slowing in the frontotemporal/frontocentral regions.
Photic stimulation elicits a driving response at 15 Hz, but the left anterior temporal sharp waves seem to be accentuated by lower frequency stimulation.
HR:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal sharp waves with some variability; some of the epileptiform discharges are maximum in the left frontal region.
Intermittent focal slowing from the left, accentuated by hyperventilation.
?Accentuated focal epileptiform activity seen in photic stimulation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are similar to a previous study dated 5/17/02.  When the epileptiform activity is more prominent in this record, photic stimulation also appeared to accentuate this pattern.  This may be due to the proximity of this recording to this patient’s postictal state.

MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The child is described as crying.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This is an extremely challenging EEG due to muscle and motion artifact, however, in the interpretable portions of the record, the background is diffusely slow with a mixture of beta and theta frequency activity.  The anticipated developmental milestones for a child of this age are not well defined.  There are brief portions of the record when the child awakens with spontaneous eye opening and eye closure.  At this time, there is a suggestion of a 6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm in a background with rhythmic 3 to 4 Hz activity.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is hypersynchronous, high amplitude, frontally predominant delta activity, as well as some rhythmic slowing from the left.  In the brief portions of the record without movement artifact, there appears to be an underlying sharp and slow wave or spike and slow wave focus from the posterior regions.
HR:  140 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a child of this age due to:
Absence of some of the developmental milestones, as well as appropriate developmental organization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Because of the amount of artifact, no other inferences should be made from this EEG.  There appears to be underlying epileptiform activity from the right as well as asynchronicity as the child drifts off to sleep.  If further characterization of this child’s epilepsy is important, a repeat, sedated study may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is awake and described as irritable.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is abnormal. Much of the waking background is low voltage beta with intermittent bursts of rhythmic, frontally predominant delta.  There are other portions of the record in apparent wakefulness where there is more significant background theta.  There are occasional bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta activity noted as well.  While there is no definite epileptiform activity, there are one or two bursts of sharply contoured activity in the right frontal region.

Drowsiness is characterized by a decrease in movement artifact and an increase in frontally predominant, rhythmic high amplitude delta.

HR:  90 BPM.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing
2. FIRDA.
3. Occasional shifting slowing with some suggestion of sharply contoured slowing on the right.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are non-specific but support a diffuse disorder of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter.  Consideration for a toxic and/or metabolic encephalopathy would be appropriate in this case. No definite epileptiform features were seen.  Comparison with previous EEGs may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely slow and disorganized.   There is a 6 to 7 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a moderate amount of generalized beta activity. Occasionally, shifting asymmetries are seen in the background with theta as well as arrhythmic delta activity.  Sleeping is evidenced by a few vertex waves. Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow and somewhat poorly organized.  There is generous rhythmic background theta and occasional shifting arrhythmic delta activity.  At times a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz can be identified.  Some portions of the record demonstrate an asymmetry with a bit higher amplitude arrhythmic theta from the left temporal region compared to the right.  There also appears to be a breach rhythm in the left frontotemporal region with higher amplitude beta frequency activity in that region.  There are bursts of sharply contoured slowing with suspicious underlying sharp waves in the left frontocentral region in sleep.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in background slowing.  Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.  At the close of the record, in maximal wakefulness, the breach rhythm from the left frontocentral region is a bit more prominent and there are a handful of discrete left central sharp waves seen in wakefulness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No previous EEGs were available for comparison.  This tracing supports a process affecting both hemispheres as well as a partial mechanism for this patient’s epilepsy.  Of note, he reports left hand shaking and the sharp waves were seen on the left.  This may be due to false localization of the epileptiform activity.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and sedated with Versed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is asymmetric and low voltage.  The normal posterior alpha rhythm is barely seen.  There is diffuse beta activity.  There is a nearly continuous left frontal and central slowing with polymorphic and arrhythmic delta activity.  Fast activity on the left anterior was also observed.  Stimulation of the patient did not cause variability.

4. Fast activity in the left anterior region.
5. Lack of variability with stimulation.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing demonstrates a severe cerebral dysfunction involving both gray and white matter.  The polymorphic slowing in the left frontal central region is suggestive of an underlying pathological process in this patient.  The diffuse beta activity together with fast activity in the left anterior region, as well as the absence of variability with stimulation, may be secondary to medications such as a pharmacological coma or patient in coma secondary to a structural lesion in the brain involving the reticular formation.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  When the patient is more stabilized or weaned off sedative medications, a follow-up EEG may be helpful.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing is suggestive of a cerebral dysfunction involving both gray and white matter.  The excessive amount of beta activity may be due to medications such as benzodiazepine use.  The low voltage pattern may be due to the patient’s age and is considered normal for a patient of this advanced age.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Topamax, and antibiotics.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates some marked intrahemispheric asymmetry.  The right hemisphere is modestly slow with a mixture of theta and smaller amounts of delta, but there is a well-defined and reactive posterior dominant rhythm.  The left hemisphere demonstrates primarily rhythmic theta with smaller amounts of delta, although at times a posterior dominant rhythm can be identified.  There are intermittent sharp waves identified from the left hemisphere.  These demonstrate variable maximum including left frontotemporal, anterior temporal, or frontal.  They range in amplitude from medium to high amplitude and are accompanied by generous after going slow waves.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing.  This is a dynamic record, and by the close of the record the activity from the right hemisphere is nearly normal and the left hemisphere is significantly less slow.
HR:  85 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Left frontal and temporal sharp waves.
Left hemispheric focal slowing.
Intermittent background slowing on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a focal mechanism for this patient’s seizures, as well as a structural or functional abnormality on the left involving both gray and white matter.  The dynamic pattern with improvement towards the close of the record may be part of a process in a patient who is overall improving.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is abnormal.  The primary frequency in the background is low voltage theta.  The interictal background is reasonably well organized for a child of this age with a 6 to 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 50 uV.  In wakefulness, this background is disrupted and an intermittent, 2.5 to 4 Hz spike and slow wave complex is seen primarily in the right occipital region.  This discharge is so prominent that there is some subtle focal slowing after the S/W.  There are also independent spike and slow wave complexes seen in the left frontocentral region (C3), but those with a classic spike and slow wave morphology are seen in the occipital region with some spread to other regions.  On occasion, they can also be seen at T5/T3 and once at P4.  Photic stimulation elicits driving, but doesn’t seem to augment these discharges.  Hyperventilation initially elicits bursts of rhythmic, frontally predominant slowing.  It doesn’t seem to elicit these interictal discharges which on one occasion are six seconds in duration.  There are bursts where the activity seems to come out of the left centrotemporal region and then 1.5 seconds later is followed by the occipital spike and slow wave activity.
HR:  116 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Frequent spike and slow wave activity seen in bursts or brief trains, primarily from the right occipital region, rarely generalized but occasionally seen in other localizations including the left frontocentral and left centrotemporal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are after going slow waves, but little focal slowing outside of the epileptiform activity.  This EEG supports a multifocal process for this patient’s epilepsy,  however, it is possible that this EEG may also represent an unusual manifestation of a generalized or an inherited epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS: Ativan and antibiotics.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated, ventilator dependent, and unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is disorganized and low voltage.  The normal posterior dominant rhythm is not seen.  After adjustment of the sensitivity, FIRDA activity as well as arrhythmic delta activity with a small amount of frontocentral beta is seen.  Some background activity can be seen with stimulation.  Transiently, the central delta activity increases.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and briefly drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz, 30 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a MU rhythm identified from the central regions, although testing is not performed. The most notable abnormality in this record is identified in wakefulness, augmented slightly in hyperventilation and includes rhythmic theta frequency activity from the right mid-temporal region.  In hyperventilation, some of this focal slowing becomes less rhythmic and slows to arrhythmic, 1.5 to 2 Hz. Brief  drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background beta activity.  Although the background is somewhat sharply contoured, there is no definite epileptiform activity in the region of the focal slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.
HR:  80 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing with disruption of faster frequency activity and rhythmic theta and arrhythmic delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a structural abnormality affecting both gray and white matter.  No definite epileptiform features were seen.  If indicated, a follow-up study may be of use.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for a child of this age with a 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Age appropriate quantities of background theta are seen.  Drowsiness is characterized by hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing, as well as slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.  Hyperventilation produces a burst of rhythmic frontal slowing initially and then muscle and movement artifact.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.  During the 11 Hz stimulation, the patient appears slightly drowsy and there is a single burst of slightly asynchronous slowing with four seconds of subtle, 4.5 Hz slowing in the occipital region, left slightly more prominent than right.
HR: 74 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This EEG must be considered within the limits of normal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The single burst that occurred may represent a drowsy pattern with some underlying head rocking and is not definitively pathologic.  No epileptiform features were seen.  Correlation with this child’s imaging may be valuable.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for a child of this age with a 10 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Noted in wakefulness and increasing in drowsiness is a right central spike and slow wave complex with a large field of spread.  This ranges from discrete to a high amplitude complex and at times the field of spread varies from central parietal to frontocentral.  It may occur as couplets or a brief run of epileptiform activity and does appear to be associated with underlying focal slowing in the central parietal region.  Photic stimulation elicits a scant driving response bilaterally.  The epileptiform activity can be seen on one occasion during photic stimulation, but is not augmented by photic. Hyperventilation elicits a small amount of theta in the background.  Following this, drowsiness is characterized by a small amount of generalized background slowing.
HR:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Right central spike and slow wave activity with occasional brief bursts of spike and slow wave activity.
Subtle underlying focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.  Because of the concomitant focal slowing, consideration for an underlying structural or functional abnormality rather than a benign localization-related epilepsy is appropriate, although this may still represent a somewhat unusual benign localization-related epilepsy.

When there is activity identified, the activity is mixed frequency, low voltage, with alpha and theta frequency activity as well as smaller amounts of delta.  The periods with activity range from 3 to 7 seconds in duration and the periods of suppression averages approximately 5 seconds in duration.  There is some variability towards the close of the record.  The periods with activity are a little bit longer lasting than those in the initial portions of the record and there is some higher amplitude theta there.  Stimulation of the patient does not clearly activate the record, although stimulation was performed primarily at the close of the record as the discontinuity is improving.  There are a few shifting asymmetries more prominent at the end of the record.  There is also a breach rhythm a bit more prominent towards the close of the record.  A single F3 sharp wave is identified.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is a relatively immediate postictal study.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage, relatively featureless with slow, low voltage delta, smaller amounts of theta frequency activity, muscle, and a fair amount of beta. Stimulation of the patient produces a small amount of theta frequency activity.  Towards the close of the record, there is a small increase in background theta.  At the very close of the record, rare, high amplitude right frontal sharp waves are seen.  At the close of the record, occasional high amplitude right frontal sharp waves, as well as bursts of sharply contoured delta are identified.

HR:  __ BPM. CHECK PRELIM SHEET

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with severe generalized slowing.
2. High amplitude right frontal sharp waves and associated focal slowing, which crescendo at the end of the EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a severe, diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter.  The beta may be due to medications.  The presence of the right frontal sharp waves really just at the close of the record with at times an almost periodic nature suggests an acute, postictal pattern and an additional EEG recording may be useful in order to make sure that additional seizures do not recur.

Child now with staring spells for one to two minutes.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial portions of the record, the child appears to be in light sleep.  The overall pattern at that time may include theta with some intermittent hypersynchronous rhythmic discharges.  There is a high amplitude vertex wave, which clearly spreads to involve C4 more significantly than the left central region.  With the use of an average reference, there seems to be underlying focal slowing with attenuation of faster frequency in the same region.  Thus, although the activity is maximum at the vertex and clearly spreads to C4, it is associated with underlying focal slowing and could not be considered a normal variant.  The child does reach stage II sleep with spindles, but this C4/CZ spike persists and as the child reaches stage II sleep, the focal slowing is more apparent.
HR:  140 BPM, occasionally irregular.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing in the right central and midline regions.
Sharp waves seen in drowsiness into stage II sleep, CZ/C4.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Despite the breach rhythm described above, this EEG suggests a partial mechanism for this patient’s epilepsy.  Correlation with imaging would be helpful in terms of localization.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. No previous EEGs were available for comparison.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a 9.5 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm in a record rich in low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  When not stimulated, the patient drifts off to sleep with slow rolling eye movements, attenuation of the alpha rhythm, and an increase in background beta.  There had been crying earlier and the patient seems to have calmed down as she drifts off to sleep.  Brief stage I sleep is characterized by vertex waves.  At 15:37, the tech notes that the patient is not responding.
PHOTIC STIMULATION: The tech attempts to awaken the patient for additional testing.  The EEG shows a slightly awake or drowsy pattern, but the tech notes that the patient is not responding to verbal stimuli.  Photic stimulation continues.  The patient is awake at this time, and a driving response is identified.  In between the driving intervals, a well-defined alpha rhythm can be seen.
HR:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage I sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  It is not clear why the patient was not responding to the technologist’s commands.  She remained motionless and consideration for either excessive drowsiness or an emotional reaction may be appropriate. The background beta may be due to this patient’s medicines.

DESCRIPTION


OF  THE   RECORD:  The   background  EEG  is  disorganized   with


generalized background slowing, excessive theta and delta activity, as well as superimposed  beta frequency activity.   Generous muscle movement  artifact obscures the observation  of the record. There is some reactivity  in response to voice, which decreases the delta activity.  The amplitude ranges from 50 to 70 uV.   Normal  alpha activity  cannot be identified. No seizure  activity was seen.

HR: 114BPM.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Slow and poorly organized background.
2.   Absent alpha activity
3.   Reactivity to stimuli

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were  identified  in this record.    This tracing supports  a diffuse  disturbance  of cerebra l function with involvement  of  both  gray and white matter.   This can be seen in patients  with toxic metabolic disturbances  or medicine effect. If epilepsy is clinical concern a repeat EEG may be helpful.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is somnolent throughout much of the record.  At this time, the EEG is markedly slow with a mixture of delta and smaller amounts of theta.  This poorly formed, periodic complex is seen in the record with a somewhat unusual field of spread picked up in the left frontal and right posterior quadrant.  Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting response with an increase in theta.  In addition, there is also spontaneous arousals with an increase in theta.  Because of the movement artifact, it is difficult to determine if this periodic delta disappears.  It appears to attenuate to some extent with stimulation.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is stimulated and tested throughout the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a relatively low voltage pattern, which is subtly discontinuous with brief bursts of relatively homogeneous rhythmic theta and mixed delta followed by brief portions of attenuation or slower lower voltage delta.  The sections with attenuation are approximately two seconds in duration.  Stimulation of the patient produces some artifact, but also seems to give a small increase in background theta.  No clinical responses are noted to the stimulation.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Replacement of normal background with a low voltage, subtly discontinuous pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: To put this record into the appropriate clinical context, it is important to know the doses and degrees of Ativan and morphine this patient has received, as these medications could contribute to this record.  In all, this EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral dysfunction as can be seen with large doses of sedative hypnotic medications, severe toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, or other severe diffuse disturbances of cerebral function.  No epileptiform features were identified.  There was some small evidence of reactivity to stimuli.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was omitted, but photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm identified with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Mixed theta is seen in drowsiness followed by vertex waves in stage I sleep.  Vertex waves and brief spindles are seen in stage II sleep.

Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is initially asleep and does not clearly activate the record.
HR:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The slightly asymmetric vertex waves may be related to this patient’s previous craniotomy.  They were seen only in the transition to and from sleep.  If additional concerns remain regarding possible underlying epileptiform activity, an additional, more prolonged sleep recording using extra electrodes between Cz/C3 and Cz/C4 may be valuable.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The child is described as quite upset and agitated throughout the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the child is agitated, but there is an underlying 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm at times reaching amplitudes close to 100 uV.  The father attempts to calm the child down with some success and there are some hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing as the child becomes drowsy.   Features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha rhythm with an increase in frontal fast activity and a handful of vertex waves. K complexes are seen in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
HR:  104 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and sleep for a child of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The normal developmental milestones for a child of this age have been met.  To evaluate a child for absence epilepsy, hyperventilation is an important test, but it does not appear that this child was able to participate in that test.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage.  There is a glimpse of an 8.5 to 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm identified in the background.  Even at lower sensitivities, the EEG remains a relatively low voltage pattern. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and an increase in background theta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is occasional temporal delta, left greater than right.  Photic stimulation does not clearly activate the record.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Modest generalized background slowing.
Subtle focal features from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In a handful of normal individuals, it may be more difficult to identify an alpha rhythm, as was the case here.  Given the MRI, the focal features described above were less prominent than one might expect.  The generalized background slowing supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a low voltage, 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is the appearance of theta activity particularly in the frontocentral regions, prominent both in early drowsiness and in hyperventilation.  Vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS are identified in stage II sleep. In stage II sleep, there are a handful of vertex waves, which may phase reverse just slightly to the left or right of the midline.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm identified bilaterally, but higher amplitude on the left compared to the right.  Overall, there is an asymmetry between the two hemispheres with higher amplitude, faster frequency activity on the left in comparison to the right.  However, there is consistent single channel artifact from the left central electrodes all the way through the record.  MU rhythm was identified from the central regions bilaterally. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response that can be identified in the occipital scalp regions bilaterally, slightly more remarkable on the left compared to the right.
HR:  114 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Asymmetry between the two hemispheres with disruption of faster frequency on the right compared to the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Because of the technical features described above, this EEG should be repeated with attention to the electrodes on the left.  It is possible that this process involves the left rather than the right, but again, the test needs to be repeated with elimination of the electrodes and, if necessary, a more prolonged sleep study to get a good quality record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is disorganized with superimposed excessively slow activity of theta and delta.  There is also a great deal of muscle movement artifact.  After the filter and sensitivity is adjusted, the excessive delta activity is also seen diffusely on the background.  The normal posterior dominant alpha rhythm is not identified.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This abnormal EEG pattern is indicative of a cerebral dysfunction involving both gray and white matter, as well as the central nuclei in the midline.  The asymmetric EEG pattern may be suggestive of a structural abnormality.  Correlation with neuroimaging studies may be helpful.  However, the pattern is non-specific as to the etiology and can be seen in patients with encephalopathy secondary to metabolic, infectious, structural lesions, or postictal phase.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is an 8 to 9 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  The patient is lethargic throughout the record.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in background theta and delta.  There is spindle activity and some shifting delta.  Photic stimulation elicits a mild driving response.
HR:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Mildly excessive theta while awake.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a mild disturbance of cerebral function.  Evaluation for the cause of this patient’s hypersomnolence may be appropriate.

MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record. This is the third EEG for this individual.  The two previous EEGs indicated that he had febrile convulsions.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for a child of this age with an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  In sleep, vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles are identified.
The major abnormality in this record, is discrete bursts of frontally predominant 3 Hz spike and wave activity seen in the transition to and from stage II sleep.  These are high amplitude discharges, typically occurring in discrete pairs, frontally predominant, symmetric, ranging from 3 to 3.5 Hz.  They can overlap with a spindle, which is a normal morphology of stage II sleep.  On one occasion, a pair of spike and wave complexes may be associated with an arousal.  At the close of the record, the child is stimulated from sleep, and occipitally predominant rhythmic slowing is followed by an awake pattern with LAMBDA when the child is more fully awake.
HR:  120 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	The appearance of frontally predominant, high amplitude spike and wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This activity was not seen in the two previous EEGs.  Correlation with this patient’s history may be helpful in that there were two previous EEGs demonstrating febrile convulsions with a child who may have developed afebrile convulsions and an EEG pattern that is most consistent with an inherited epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a mainly asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is in sleep throughout much of the record.  Much of the record demonstrates stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  Attempts at stimulation such as in hyperventilation doesn’t produce much of an arousal pattern, but just prior to photic stimulation, the tech uses auditory stimulation and a well-defined, 11 Hz, 50 uV alpha rhythm is seen briefly until the patient falls off to sleep.  The tech attempts to keep the patient awake for photic stimulation, unsuccessfully.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is normal, but the patient does demonstrate hypersomnolence and the tech is having great difficulty keeping him awake during testing.  Additional evaluation with a sleep specialist may be necessary.  No epileptiform features were seen.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This child had multiple absence seizures, some of which were clinically apparent even without cognitive testing.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background is well organized with an 11 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  LAMBDA activity is seen as is central MU.  In some cases the LAMBDA is somewhat asymmetric.
The major abnormality in this record is absence seizures characterized by bursts of rhythmic, high amplitude frontally predominant 3.5 to 5 Hz spike and wave activity with discharges lasting up to 10 seconds.  Clinical correlates of these three discharges include impaired recall of a code word and eye blinking, but during the fourth seizure, the patient actually seemed to gesture during her seizure.
Other abnormalities include occipitally predominant 4 Hz spike and wave activity, which seems to be bilateral and isolated, right or left temporal spike and slow wave complexes.  The major of the independent, right or left temporal spike and slow wave complexes were simple in nature, as may be seen in benign disorders, but in one case there was some additional focal slowing from the right.
Hyperventilation did appear to elicit one of these spells, although the absence seizures occurred spontaneously.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.
HR:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Four absence seizures lasting ten seconds in duration and associated with impairment of awareness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings were communicated by the tech on the day of the record in that this child is currently not treated with seizure medications.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and includes a background that is intermittently reasonably well organized with a definable posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 7 Hz, 40 uV.  There are intermittent bursts of rhythmic frontal delta and/or triphasic waves.  There are also sharp waves identified in the record with variable maximum and a variable field of spread.  They may be in the left occipital or T5 left posterior temporal.  They have a generous field of spread in the bi-occipital regions and some of them have a different field in the left posterior temporal region, but involving the centroparietal areas as well.  The sharp waves can be seen in association with the bursts of FIRDA or triphasic waves, or independently.  Photic stimulation does seem to elicit a driving response at faster flash frequencies.
Features of drowsiness include an increase in the FIRDA.

Bursts of triphasic waves.
Epileptiform activity primary from the left hemisphere with an unusual spread.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The FIRDA and the triphasic waves suggest that there may well be an underlying metabolic encephalopathy.  This may accentuate the epileptiform activity described above.  No seizures were recorded, however, this is a very abnormal background.  Additional clinical evaluation may be important.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Much of the record includes a drowsy pattern with background theta.  There is a transition to and from stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles.  There is an intrahemispheric asymmetric noted intermittently with intermittent rhythmic delta from the left hemisphere particularly the temporal region. Intermittent rhythmic slowing can be identified in wakefulness, which also includes at times a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.   Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is falling off to sleep, but a trace driving response is seen.
HR:  104 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Intermittent rhythmic slowing from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No definite epileptiform features were identified in this record.  An additional recording in the lab when the patient is a bit more comfortable may be helpful to further characterize epileptiform activity.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a well-organized background with an 11 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background beta and attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  Hyperventilation does not activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicits a photomyogenic and vigorous driving response, but not a photoparoxysmal response.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF  THE  RECORD: In wakefulness, there  is  a  10  Hz,  50  uV poste1ior dominant rhythm.  The patient has shaking of his head from side to side.   This is noted in the waking background.   Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record.   The patient has increased shaking of his head from side to side during hyperventilation, but remains responsive with the technologist.   The shaking produces muscle artifact.   The patient appears to be very nervous.  No pathological abnormalities were seen in hyperventilation.   Hyperventilation was followed by brief drowsiness, but deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
During photic stimulation, the patient had tremulousness of his hands, shaking of his head back and forth, and unusual vocalizations. These behaviors were associated with muscle a1iifact in the EEG, but no epileptiform activity.    The patient also had shaking from side to side and up and down with asynchronous movements.  The behaviors lasted for four minutes.  After the patient stopped moving around, LAMBDA waves were seen followed by an alpha rhythm.   As this prolonged behavior resolved, the patient has shaking of his right hand and ""feels like hell.""

INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG is performed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electro-placement  with 1 channel of EKG. The EEG demonstrates jerking of the patient including mouth and shoulders.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	Background EEG is markedly abnormal. There is cerebral activity identified bilaterally. There is sharply contoured paroxysmal approximately 3 Hz activity in the occipital regions, some of which seems to have an underlying sharper spike or fast component with it. This does not entirely correlate with the twitching, and the twitching is typically a very rapid myoclonic jerk with a different frequency. The occipitally predominant pattern is not clearly associated with a sustained motor phenomenon. In some sections of the record, the activity is clear. The epileptiform activity in the occipital regions is clearly maximum on the right. Some of the myoclonic jerking almost produces a clear EEG correlate that can be seen
by the camera, although it is seen by the tech, and at other
times the jerking can be witnessed, but overall the camera seems to underestimate the activity. Towards the close of the record, the myoclonic jerking seems to have abated, but the occipitally predominant slowing with this underlying fast discharge
persists.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, background EEG included the 9.5 posterior dominant rhythm a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. There is a small amount of background theta. In relaxed wakefulness, there are a handful of subtle sharp waves from the left or right temporal region. Most of them are small and discreet, but some have a more of a broader morphology, although they are never high in amplitude. They lack the simplicity of benign epileptiform transience of sleep. The patient has stimulated for hyperventilation and these morphologies disappear. Hyperventilation is performed with good effort producing an increase in background theta. There is a suggestion that it may also accentuate an arrhythmic delta from the left with independent right and left temporal sharp and slow wave, or spike and slow wave complexes. The epileptiform activity identified in hyperventilation was denoted on the record. Towards the close of the record, high amplitude right inter temple spike and slow wave complexes with generous field of spread were observed. As the patient becomes drowsy, the right temporal sharp waves are again well defined and the left temporal features are not as commonly identified. Other features of sleep include vertex waves and posts. Photic stimulation elicits harmonic with supra harmonic striving.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right anterior temple spike and slow wave complexes accentuated by hyperventilation and seen in the transition from wakefulness into drowsiness.
2. Occasional more poorly defined left temporal sharp waves.
Clinical correlation: For this young adult with a strong family history of epilepsy, this study today is most supportive of a localization related mechanism with a right inter temple sharp wave with a generous field of spread. There is a remarkably bigger striving response, but not a clearly pathological one.
Additional review of the epilepsy in the family would be important to know if this individual's epilepsy is similar or just similar to other members in the kindred. In contrast to previous studies, the vast majority of epileptiform features today were on the right rather than the left.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at bedside in ICU using Standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is described as agitated.
DESCRIPTION  OF THE RECORD:  When the patient is resting comfortably, the background EEG includes generous beta from the left. There is an interhemispheric asymmetry with more arrhythmic delta from the right
in comparison to the left. Overall, there is generous beta. Occasional POSTS are observed. Rare right mid to anterior temporal sharp waves at the generous field of spread are noted in the background. Spontaneous arousal or arousal with stimulation is associated with dramatic increase in alpha and beta frequency activity.
HR: 88 bpm
IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Excess beta.
2. 	Superimposed focal slowing with arrhythmic delta activity from the right frontotemporal/frontocentral region.
3. Rare right anterotemporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	No seizures were recorded. There is no prominent periodic activity. This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the right. The sharp waves are congruent with the history of seizure. The generous beta may be due to the medications.

INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, background EEG is well organized with low voltage, 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of voltage, frontocentral beta activity. There is a very subtle low voltage theta observed from the left temporal region which is rhythmic in nature and present prior to hyperventilation. Hyperventilation does not otherwise activate the record. As the patient becomes drowsy intermittent rhythmic theta is identified in the left temporal region and transitions from anterotemporal to posterotemporal. Photic stimulation elicits a low voltage, harmonic and superharmonic driving response.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement  with 1 channel of EKG 6 hours after the cardiac arrest.  The patient is intubated.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  It is suppressed with brief apex of high amplitude activity.  There is no audio on the video.  The patient is tachypneic, and has intermittent bursts of paroxysmal high amplitude activity which may occur once per minute, or as often as 3 times in a minute.   Over time, reviewing the entire record, it is clear that the patient has a small hiccup which sometimes produces jerking of his head with the events.  This is best observed when reviewing the EEG and a fixed rate of 60 seconds per page.  There is also a triangular-shaped  wave form in the right occipital region with some
spread to the left that may occur as often as 4 times in a 20 second period or 10 times in a second.

INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated and responds to tactile stimuli by moving about.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The most prominent features are a posteriorly predominant periodic complex which appears maximum in the right rather than the left.  The periodic sharp activity in this record has variable fields and variable maximum, including 02, T6 and even F8 phase reversal. Other maxima for these periodic complexes include the left frontal region.  Stimulation
of the patient produces an arousal, as described above.  There are independent,
periodic sharp waves observed from either hemisphere, some of which are asynchronous and some of which are seen exclusively unilateral on the left or the right, although the right occipital seems to be the most prominent discharge in this record. The background includes smaller amounts of irregular theta and delta as well as intermittently discontinuous pattern.  Periods of suppression which are one second in duration typically occur after an occipital high amplitude periodic sharp wave.  Agitation including movement of the patient's head is not associated with ictal change.  On one occasion there is a brief build up of the right occipital sharp waves.
HR: 	72  bpm
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Periodic complexes from multiple locations in both hemispheres.
2. 	A brief buildup of right occipital sharp waves.
3. 	Markedly abnormal background.
4. 	Intermittently  discontinuous pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a very irritative process.   In addition, the discontinuity  and the markedly abnormal background  are worrisome features following cardiac arrest.  Additional evaluation for some clinical seizures as well as evaluation of the severity of this patient's anoxic encephalopathy is warranted.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. As the patient becomes drowsy there is an increase in theta. In addition, shifting arrhythmic delta activity, some of which is sharply contoured on the left with a subtle underlying sharp wave is observed. As the patient becomes drowsier, shifting arrhythmic delta can be seen from either temporal region. Some of this focal slowing on the right is posterior temporal.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates an
intrahemispheric asymmetry. There is focal slowing from the left in comparison to the
right. There is disruption of faster frequency activity as well as some sharply contoured
activity in the left temporal region. The patient intermittently arouses, but does not
maintain that level of arousal. As he drifts off to sleep, bursts of sharply contoured focal
slowing and subtle actual sharp waves are observed in the left hemisphere with atypical
phase reversal T1, but occasionally T3 or T5. Vertex waves and spindles were
observed in stage 2 sleep. In the sleep section, the epileptiform activity transitions to a
left posterior temporal focus. In addition, there are also POSTS observed bilaterally.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1 .
Focal slowing from the left with sharply contoured delta and sharp waves mid to
anterior temporal in wakefulness transitioning to posterior temporal in sleep.
2.
Hypersomnolence.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the left.
The epileptiform features suggest a predisposition to seizures. The hypersomnolence
may be due to the use of sedative hypnotic medication. If clinically indicated, additional
observation for an underlying seizure disorder is appropriate.

are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is
appropriately organized for this child's age. There is a 10 hertz posterior dominant
rhythm reaching amplitudes up to 70 microvolts with posterior slow waves.
Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing an increase in amplitude
of the background. Following hyperventilation, the child drifts off to sleep with vertex
waves and spindles. This is preceded by bursts of rhythmic theta. Photic stimulation
elicits driving bilaterally. At the close of the record following photic stimulation, the
patient has paroxysmal bursts of high amplitude slowing which is notched, but is not
definitively epileptiform.

epoch of drowsiness. In the absence of definitive spike and wave discharge, this must
be considered a normal finding.

MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, Tylenol, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using the standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and
sometimes a little agitated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There are brief portions in the record where the
patient is calm, but awake. The background EEG at this time includes some alpha
frequency activity with a hint of a 1 0 Hertz alpha rhythm on the left. It is also seen on
occasion on the right. There is some superimposed focal slowing observed in the right
hemisphere in relaxed wakefulness. Features of drowsiness include attenuation of
alpha and theta frequency activity as well as some delta. There is also some occasional
head rocking, but a suggestion of some right frontal delta.
HR: 120 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intermittent focal slowing from the right.
2. Intermittent generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The single sharp wave from the left is an unanticipated
finding. Given the context of this, the patient's high fever, and potential for sweat artifact,
if seizures are an· important consideration, reevaluation of the left temporal sharp wave
is recommended. Focal slowing on the right with disruption of fast or frequency activities
is congruent with a history of a MCA cortical infarct.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins the patient is awake. There is
an intra hemispheric asymmetry with a relative disruption of faster frequency in the left in
comparison to the right. There is an alpha rhythm observed on the right, but it is
somewhat slow, ranging from 7 to 8 Hydrochlorothiazide. Features of drowsiness
include slow rolling eye movements. Intermittent agitation is observed. Very brief

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system
of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is observed to have a right
craniotomy defect. Photic stimulation is performed. This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the alpha rhythm is present
bilaterally but a bit disrupted on the right. It reaches 8.3 Hz maximum. There is a clear
intra-hemispheric asymmetry as well as a craniotomy defect and a breach rhythm.
Faster frequency activity in wakefulness is initially disrupted on the right. In addition,
there is arrhythmic delta activity in the right hemisphere with an underlying right mid to
posterior temporal region, phase reversal at T4 but at times nearly isoelectric at T4/T6. As the patient transitions in and out sleep, this sharp wave on 1 occasion appears
maximum at T 4. In addition, as the patient transitions into sleep, the breach rhythm
becomes more prominent. As beta frequency activity increases in drowsiness, the beta
is accentuated in the right frontal region. Photic stimulation does elicit a driving
response although the patient is drifting off to sleep in photic. The photic driving
response is more vigorous on the left in comparison than the right. It is also confounded
by the fact that intermittently she started to fall off to sleep and POSTS are observed.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intra-hemispheric asymmetry with focal slowing on the right, arrhythmic delta

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports on a structural abnormality on the right
involving gray and white matter. The sharp waves support a localization-related
mechanism for epilepsy. The prior craniotomy would explain the breach rhythm and can
accentuate the epileptiform activity.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at beside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is drowsy. There is no hyperventilation
nor photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG demonstrates an asymmetry. The activity in the left is lower amplitude than that on the right. In this apparently awake patient, there is a
relatively low voltage pattern with excess theta and a glimpse of an alpha rhythm. The patient seems to wax and wane, drifting off to sleep, arousing briefly.
Occasional bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta activity are seen. Some sharply contoured wicket­ like data is also observed. Stimulation of the patient produces a clear arousal and with stimulation, the overall background demonstrates a relatively unremarkable awake but low voltage pattern with what is likely a somewhat slow alpha rhythm. After this the patient drifts off to sleep.
HR:	72 bpm, occasionally irregular.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.   Interhemispheric asymmetry observed most prominently in drowsiness  with lower voltage more suppressed pattern on the left and a somewhat slow pattern on the right.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is asleep throughout much of the record, but a wake pattern is observed.  The background  EEG is remarkable for an interhemispheric asymmetry.  The activity is lower voltage on the right compared to the left. The left is higher amplitude.  In stage 2 sleep there are spindle activity on the left, but not on the right.   In
addition, there is some bursts of sharply contoured delta and a handful of sharp waves in the left
central or central temporal region. Stimulation of the patient produces an alerting response with an ability for the patient to follow commands.  At that time the activity on the left is essentially rhythmic theta, but remains lower voltage and suppressed  on the right.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record. This was a 1 hour study.


DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, a background EEG includes at 10 Hz, 50 microvolts, symmetric reactive posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. Early in the record, the patient had behavior. The behavior is characterized by shaking of her hands and shaking of the head up and down and from side to side. The audio does not work and the patient's head is not included in the video. The patient is able to tell the technologist at 8:55 that she is about to experience the activity and the activity began at 8:56 12 and concludes at 8:57 28. A code word is given after the event which the patient can recall. Hyperventilation is performed just before the event and does not produce epileptiform activity. Hyperventilation is repeated afterwards and does not activate the record. Following the clinical event, the technologist includes the patient's head in the camera.
Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response. Features of sleep include vertexes and posts.

HR: 72 bpm.

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This patient had a behavioral event during the EEG. Based on the technologist's notes, there was no impairment of awareness. In addition the characteristics of the movements were typical of a non-epileptic seizure with waxing and waning, movements in different planes and different directions as well as bilateral motor activity without impairment of awareness. A search for the underlying cause for these behaviors is advised.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation performed. Prior EEGs.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During wakefulness, a slowing of the background in the delta and theta range is seen. The record is mildly asymmetric with a bit of slowing seen more in the right hemisphere. The record overall is of low amplitude. Increased eye flutter is seen throughout the record. Muscle artifact is also seen in increasing amounts on the record. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.

HR: 54 bpm with some ectopic beats.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked slowing of the background mostly of a delta range, mildly increased on the right hemisphere.
2. Increasingly low amplitude.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The slowing of the background is consistent with a picture of chronic encephalopathy. Previous EEGs have shown occipital discharges, but there was no epileptiform activity seen on this record.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated but arousable.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates initially a very low voltage, suppressed pattern. When the patient is resting comfortably, the EEG includes a low voltage, suppressed pattern with intermittent discontinuity and intermittent asymmetries including times of pattern that is discontinuous on one side versus the other. In addition, when cerebral activity is seen with the patient resting quietly, it is of theta frequency activity. Stimulation of the patient produces oral movements and eye movements. At that point, the EEG demonstrates relatively low-voltage, featureless pattern.

HR: 84 bpm.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Low-voltage, relatively suppressed pattern at times.
2. Intermittently discontinuous pattern.
3. Shifting asymmetries with intermittent discontinuity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Stigmata that suggest a chronic encephalopathy include an arousal response with eye opening with an otherwise very low-voltage pattern. No epileptiform features were observed. In this individual with right basal ganglia hemorrhage, there are shifting asymmetries. There were portions of the record with relative suppression on one side or the other but there are also prominent bilateral features.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital  video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement. 	.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  At the start of the study, a lot of initial movement muscle artifact is seen. For a short period of time, however, it clears and a slow background is seen with extensively delta with theta seen. There is also interhemispheric asymmetry with slower rhythm seen in the right hemisphere. As the record continues, again on the video, movement of the patient is seen and the background is obscured by muscle artifact.

HR:     90 bpm and irregular.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Slowing of the background consistently with delta and some theta activity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There is no epileptiform activity seen on this record, but much of the EEG is obscured with muscle artifact from the patient's moving. The slow background is nonspecific, but is consistent with an encephalopathy.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized.  It is primarily sharp with contra-data frequency background with shifting arrhythmic delta activity, more so on the left. In addition to the sharply contoured delta, there are rare sharp waves noted in relaxed wakefulness.  As the awake recording continues, there is muscle artifact observed.  Some of the sharp waves demonstrate a left anterior temporal maximum but phase reverse at T2 (dipole issue likely). Vertex waves are observed in stage I sleep.  Posts are observed in stage I sleep.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a dramatic
intrahemispheric asymmetry. While the right hemisphere is moderately slow with a theta frequency pattern and some delta, the left hemisphere demonstrates essentially continuous mixed arrhythmic theta and delta, primarily delta, with sharp waves identified in the left hemisphere with variable maximum including C3, T3 and F7. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing and an increase in beta with beta spindles on the right. The sharp waves on the left range from broadly contoured wave forms to higher amplitude spike and slow wave complexes. The patient arouses spontaneously.

HR: 112 bpm and irregular

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Prominent intrahemispheric asymmetry with arrhythmic delta activity on the right and disruption of faster frequency activity.
2. Sharp waves identified in the left hemisphere with variable maximum including left central and temporal region.

CLINICAL INTERPRETATION: This EEG supports a structural or functional process on the left which is epileptogenic in nature. No seizures were recorded.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the record begins, a slow bilateral background of theta and delta activity is seen.  There is an interhemispheric asymmetry with some faster activity seen  in the right hemisphere. The background is suppressed.  In the left hemisphere arrhythmic sharp delta waves are seen with a huge field of spread. At times they stop and they start as the record continues, and at times they seem to go away. There is no evolution, but by the end of the record there is a question whether there would be more evolution in this left hemispheric sharp wave pattern as the record continued.

2.	Slow background with slower frequencies in the left hemisphere.
3. 	Suppression of the background.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:   The slowing of the background is nonspecific but could be a result of severe cerebral dysfunction and the focal slowing could be a result of the structural abnormality from her history of a subdural hematoma. The continued left hemispheric sharp waves is consistent with an irrigative focus for epilepsy. At the end of the record there is a question whether there would be continuation and evolution of these sharp waves, which we do not see in this record.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and comatose.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates an invariant low-voltage suppressed pattern with background 7 Hz theta activity. The theta appears in the temporal electrodes and those on the left a bit more than the right. There is an occasional focus of delta. Stimulation of the patient produces artifacts. The activity can be remontaged but again the low voltage theta is highly suspicious for an external artifact, particularly as it appears in the eye leads.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is abnormal. The overall background is slow with posterior dominate rhythm below 8.5 Hz. The technologist notes that the patient's scalp is dirty and that she seems extraordinarily sleepy. In relaxed
wakefulness there are paroxysmal bursts of high amplitude rhythmic frontally predominate 3.5 to
4 Hz activity some of which is notched.  The patient is awake, during hyperventilation and the video is used to confirm the patient is in fact awake, but vertex sharp waves are noted with paroxysmal bursts of rhythmic theta in hyperventilation. Other features of hyperventilation include the intermittent paroxysmal slowing. Photic stimulation does not active the record, but again these paroxysmal 3.5 Hz activity in the frontocentral regions, activity is noted with a questionable vertex sharp wave.
HR:   72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Background slowing.
2.	Paroxysmal 3.5 Hz activity.
3.	Vertex waves in apparent  wakefulness.
4.	?Frontocentral spike and wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This appears to be a pathological pattern, however, additional evaluation may be appropriate marked sleep deprivation could produce micro-epochs of stage 1 sleep.  Then, if she is thought to have seizures, more prolonged EEG recording may be helpful to  more completely characterize her epileptiform focus.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is poorly intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly suppressed with low voltage beta. There is a scant amount of low voltage/mixed theta-delta, primarily with 3 Hz delta activity and a smaller amount of 6 Hz theta. In this low voltage record, this activity is more prominent on the left. Using lower sensitivity, very slow periodic slowing can be noted in the left hemisphere with a subtle left frontotemporal sharp wave. Stimulation of the patient produces muscle artifact. As recording continues, a simple morphology sharp wave can be identified with some variability sometimes maximum FP/F7 and other times F3. Stimulation of the patient produces muscle artifact.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a relatively low voltage pattern. There is a glimpse of a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is a prominent intrahemispheric asymmetry with some rhythmic slowing from the left mid temporal region and at times T1-T3 sharp waves. As the patient drifts off to sleep, some of these sharp waves are a bit more prominent at P3. The rhythmic slowing persists into stage 2 sleep and occurs as brief bursts but without definitive frequency evolution. During the prominent bursts of rhythmic slowing, testing is not performed and during the later section of the record there are trains of sharp waves noted in the record now at T5. Photic stimulation elicits driving response better represented on the right than the left, but present bilaterally. In the end of the record, which is when photic stimulation is seen the sharp waves are a bit more prominent at T5, T3.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a symmetric, reactive, 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Wicket activity is identified from the temporal regions bilaterally. Discrete right temporal sharp waves are noted at T2. They are so discrete in nature and occur out of the wicket that they almost look like an artifact; however, there is clearly an after-going slow wave and there is disruption of the background. They are also nearly the amplitude of the EKG artifact but clearly can be differentiated from the EKG as fortunately they do not occur in conjunction with the EKG. These appear in relaxed wakefulness as the patient start to drift off toward sleep. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous bilateral driving response.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. It is difficult to identify an alpha rhythm and in maximum wakefulness, there is scant background theta. Hyperventilation is performed with good effort producing an increase in amplitude of the background and at times a 9 Hz alpha rhythm can be glimpsed. Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous bilateral driving response.
IMPRESSION: This EEG is equivocally abnormal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is a small amount of excess theta noted in the background. Testing such as counting backward from 10 or other mental activities to ensure that the patient was maximally awake were not performed and could have been helpful to clarify this.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is photic stimulation but no hyperventilation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the EEG is well organized, but when the patient becomes drowsy, the background demonstrates intermittent arrhythmic delta activity from the left temporal region. In addition, as the patient becomes drowsy intermittently, the alpha rhythm drops out much faster on the right compared to the left. What appears to be vertex waves are also accompanied by some right central temporal slowing and the vertex waves are consistently maximum on the right. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intermittent focal slowing on the left.
2. Asymmetric vertex waves which are maximum on the right.
3. An alpha asymmetry in drowsiness with drop out of the alpha rhythm earlier on the right compared to the left.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports pathology in either hemisphere. Although there were no epileptiform features, correlation with imaging is suggested. Typically, disrupted alpha would suggest pathology on the right and that would be supported by the focal right central temporal delta.

INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of
EKG. The patient was intubated in the ICU. This is a bedside requested.
DESCRIPTION OF BACKGROUND:
Background EEG demonstrates a markedly abnormal pattern. On the left hemisphere, there is a continuous pattern with
a mixture of alpha and theta frequency activity. The right hemisphere demonstrates right frontal arrhythmic delta activity
with the polyspike component. Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting response. Use of Ativan produces
background slowing and blunting of the PLED. Stimulation of the patient produces an arousal.
The epileptiform activity is high amplitude with a generous field of spread, but it has a very characteristic. Periodicity 0.8
Hz and does not evolve. With the use of Ativan, the epileptiform discharge decreases in amplitude, but the periodicity is
not affected. The use of Ativan does, however, produce slowing in the contralateral hemisphere.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 6 Hz, which does not appear to be reactive to eye opening.  There is not a normal amount of frontal central beta.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
During the recording the patient is stimulated, but there appears to be no clear change in the record.  At times intermittently there is periods of faster frequencies coming through the background, but this does not appear to be due to stimulation and it just occurs for seconds.  It may represent arousal.  Overall the background is also consistent with some abnormal discharges, which I will discuss in the next paragraph.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 mV.  In addition, there is intermittent triphasic waves seen throughout the recording.
There is also some sharply contoured transient that are maximal in the midline prefrontal, as well as vertex region.  However, this has more of a metabolic/triphasic morphology and does not appear to be epileptic.

Abnormal Discharges:
1. Focal slow waves seen in the frontal regions bilaterally slightly more prominent on the left than the right. At times more prominent at TP2 and at time more prominent at F3 and at times also seen at F4 and C4.
2. Sharp waves seen bifrontally mainly at FP1 and F7, but at times also at F4 and T4. Some of the sharp waves have an atypical field and appeared to be poly spiky.
Seizures: None.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to bilateral frontal and anterior temporal slowing as well as intermittent frontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction and irritability in the bilateral frontal regions which may be consistent with the known injury. No seizures were seen.

INTRODUCTION:  Condition of the recording:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead placement.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a low-amplitude 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  Anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient is weak.  No clear sleep architecture is present. Intermittent polymorphic theta and delta activity are captured over the left temporal region.  Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation results in no additional abnormalities.
FINDINGS:
Mild background disorganization.
Intermittent mild left temporal slowing.
No stage 2 sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake-only 22-minute electroencephalogram due to mild background disorganization and mild intermittent left temporal slowing.  Mild background slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal left temporal slowing indicates a possible underlying structural lesion, and in this case, could be consistent with patient history of Alzheimer's type dementia.  No epileptiform discharges were captured; however, stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinical indication for seizures persist, a repeat study with stage 2 sleep may be of benefit.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  In stage 2 sleep vertex waves, K complexes, spindles and posts were noted.
Notable in this record were intermittent bursts of somewhat rhythmic 3-4 Hz delta activity.  Some of the bursts were sustained.  A handful of these are sharply contoured but without a definitive sharp and slow wave complex.  Wicket was also noted in relaxed wakefulness.
Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Rhythmic, left temporal focal slowing.
Sharply contoured left temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive sharp waves were seen although there was some sharply contoured slowing.  This EEG supports a structural functional abnormality on the left and may be correlated with imaging.  It is a pattern that is not atypical for epilepsy but this individual does have a previous left frontal infarct.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm was 9-9.5 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is 7-7.5 Hz diffuse theta activity seen during wakefulness, which is distributed symmetrically.  There is presence of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness was characterized by disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm and slowing of the background and absence of muscle and eye blink artifacts.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and did not result in a driving response.  Heart rate was 70 beats per minute with arrhythmia.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to diffuse slowing of the background with theta activity seen during wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings could be due to toxic, metabolic, hypoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of sedating medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  The general clinical correlation was recommended.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures are identified in this record.  Note that the patient has arrhythmia.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was ventilated, and she was not responsive to the technologist.
TECHNICAL:  There is a fair amount of muscle and twitch artifact noted in the background.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is low to medium amplitude with continuous delta and theta and smaller amount of beta.  There are some shifting asymmetries in this bedside record with a bit of head rocking artifact in the right posterior quadrant.  Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in beta as well as muscle, and then some posteriorly predominant rhythmic delta.  Intermittent muscle twitch artifact was observed.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal, sedated bedside record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  There was some evidence of reactivity to stimulation.  To put this EEG in appropriate clinical context, it would be important to know the degree of sedation for this individual.  There was some reactivity and variability noted in the background.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed modulated moderate amplitude 2.5 Hz alpha activity.  Voltages of posterior dominant rhythm are higher over the right hemisphere by approximately 50%.  During sleep, symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles and K complexes are captured.  Prominent POSTS (positive single sharp transients of sleep) are captured primarily over the right hemisphere.  Additionally, epochs similar to REM sleep are observed as well.  During those epochs, bursts of alpha activity is captured over the posterior leads, primarily over the right hemisphere only.  Hyperventilation does not result in change in the background.  Photic stimulation results in asymmetrical driving at low frequencies with occipital driving observed only over the right hemisphere.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was an awake and asleep record.
Technical: There was no mention that this patient had an asymmetric cranium or asymmetric eye movements. There were a number of artifacts noted and there was an unacceptable impedance at SP2. There was also a fair amount of muscle artifact noted in the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized.  There is an alpha rhythm of 7-8 Hz.
The record can be re-reviewed to eliminate the FP2 artifact but there still appears to be some focal slowing in the right frontal region.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is again an appearance of some arrhythmic delta activity in the right hemisphere, a bit more prominent in the right frontal area.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude in the background.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Given the technical features described above, the focal findings described above are of unclear clinical significance.  A repeat tracing with careful attention to the impedance is appropriate.

INTRODUCTION:
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency up to gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude, beta and delta, 1-2 second periods of background discontinuity and diffuse abundant low to moderate amplitude EMG artifact.  EMG artifact is highest in amplitude over the right frontal and frontocentral electrodes.  According to the EEG technologist, no noticeable twitching/movement was identified.  Video review does not reveal a source of this EMG artifact.  Any epileptiform discharges would be masked by this EMG artifact.  There were no clear electrographic seizures.  A single EKG lead demonstrated a heart rate of fewer than 60 beats a minute up to 2 seconds, this is between some of the QRS complexes.

Moderate diffuse slowing.
Periods of discontinuity.
Abundant EMG artifact that would obscure any underlying epileptiform activity.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 36-year-old man with end-stage renal disease, hypertension, and diabetes presented to the hospital with multiple seizures and was admitted with DKA.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilaudid, nitroglycerin, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standardized 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.  This was challenging procedure because the tech had difficulties with incidences and could not get the incidence under 5 ohms and also had difficulties with electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the alpha rhythm was an 8 Hz and shifting and slowing.  This was primarily in drowsiness and hypnagogic hypersynchrony pattern was characterized by increased theta in drowsiness.  Vertex waves were seen in stage 1 sleep.  The patient was hypersomnolent and was falling asleep during photic stimulation.  Heart rate was 84 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Hypersomnolent pattern.
Mild slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Shifting and slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to the background slowing.  No epileptiform features were seen.  Due to the technical considerations and the patient's cooperation, followup outpatient study can be helpful to assess potential epileptiform activity.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 34-year-old woman with a history of seizure disorder who now presents with increasing seizure frequency.  Her last seizure occurred approximately two weeks ago.  Her medications include Dilantin, sertraline, venlafaxine and diphenhydramine.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10-1/2 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness, the amount of diffuse theta and frontal central beta increases.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces mild diffuse background slowing as well as brief bursts of moderate to high amplitude diffuse frontally predominant somewhat rhythmic theta activity.  Similar activity is observed post hyperventilation as well as during drowsiness.  Photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  Bursts of diffuse frontally predominant moderate to high amplitude somewhat rhythmic theta activity are also observed during photic stimulation.
A single EKG lead demonstrates a heart rate that is at times fewer than 60 beats per minute.
FINDINGS:
No stage II sleep.
No clear epileptiform discharges.
Brief bursts of moderate to high amplitude diffuse frontally predominant theta activity that occur during hyperventilation, post hyperventilation, during drowsiness and during photic stimulation.
IMPRESSION:  This is likely a normal awake and drowsy 30-minute EEG.

CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:  The recording is performed according to the standard 10/20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The recording was reviewed intermittently by the attending physician throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of low amplitude, diffuse beta activity, very diffuse fast activity in the beta frequency range admixed with periods of a background of discontinuity.  With stimulation, the background becomes continuous and voltages increase somewhat.  There appears to be a paucity of faster frequencies over the right temporal region.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was comatose, unresponsive and was examined during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The overall pattern is one of diffuse delta with slow delta and bursts of frontally predominant delta.  In addition, there is prominent beta noted in the background.  The patient was examined on 2 occasions.  On 1 occasion, there was a subtle increase in rhythmic delta which is a little bit faster, trending more towards 3 Hz was noted when the patient was  unstimulated.  Tactile stimulation at the very end of the EEG also produced a little bit of reactivity.

IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing.
Absence of the normal wave forms.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Although reactivity to external stimuli was subtle it was present and this is a positive prognostic factor.  Of note, this patient's sedative hypnotic medications can play a role in the pattern described above.

This is a greater than 20 minute, technically satisfactory EEG aside from T1-T2 impedances which were slightly greater than 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 7.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with generous background theta.
The overall, awake background is relatively low voltage.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in rhythmic theta.  Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
Epileptiform discharges:  Notable in this record were left anterior temporal sharp waves, which were relatively rare.  They ranged from a high amplitude 70 microvolt  T1 sharp waves to more discreet left anterior temporal sharp waves with variable maximum.  On 1 occasion, there is a phase reversal in the referential montage between T1 and F7.  One of these discharges also seems to have more of a left frontocentral localization.

bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the

theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz
activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Brief bursts of bitemporal theta-delta activity are noted during wakefulness, increasing during
drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the neuro ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  This is a technically very challenging EEG in an uncooperative patient.  The EEG captures the awake and agitated state.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the initial sections of the record, the patient is awake and moving about.  The overall background is quite disorganized.  Head rocking artifact is noted, but there was also an increase in amplitude in the right scalp electrodes particularly the right temporal regions.  When the patient is a bit more cooperative, is a bit more theta.  The nurses attempt to console the patient with little success.  At some point, there is an increase in beta as the patient's Versed starts to take effect and the patient started snoring.  As she does so, a more restricted area of focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant was noted and there are discernible, right occipitotemporal sharp waves noted.  The sedation does not last long and the patient is quickly agitated again.  The pattern from the left is also disorganized, but lacks the same quantity of arrhythmic delta activity.  The sharp waves are irregular with a variable maximum and can include T4 or O2.

Heart rate N/A.

IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging, but abnormal EEG due to:
1. Sharp waves from the right hemisphere, typically posterior temporal, but not exclusively occipital or posterior temporal, sometimes mid temporal.
2. Arrhythmic delta activity, right posterior quadrant.
3. Background slowing and disorganization from both hemispheres.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  This EEG supports a structural process on the right involving gray and white matter as well as a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.  Additional recording may be considered if the patient suffers additional seizures.

EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR and no AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic
theta<<delta activity and diffuse frontally predominant polyspikes.  As the recording opens,
polyspikes are low in amplitude and infrequent. As the recording progresses,  they gradually
increase in frequency, amplitude and duration.  Clinically, they are associated with diffuse body
jerks.  Four brief (~20 seconds) clinical and electrographic seizures are captured.  Clinically patient
has diffuse body jerks that rapidly evolve into rhythmic clonic movements of upper extremities.
Patient is given vecuronium at the time of the last seizure, so no movement is identified with that
event.  Electrographically, the first 3 seizures are characterized by diffuse EMG artifact. Patient is
paralyzed at the time of the fourth seizure.  That seizure starts with moderate amplitude diffuse
polyspikes that evolve into a mixture of diffuse 8-10 Hz  activity with underriding low amplitude fast
activity.  At the end of the seizures, rhythmic ~ 3 Hz diffuse delta activity is seen accompanied by
the underriding fast activity.  After each seizure, frequency, duration and amplitude of polyspikes
decrease dramatically.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is no change in the background
activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Seizure, few, ~20 second each, generalized
Polyspikes, abundant diffuse
No reactivity
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe
Interpretation:
This is a very abnormal 1 hour EEG in a comatose patient due to severe diffuse slowing, lack of
reactivity, frequent diffuse epileptiform discharges (clinically associated with generalized body jerks)
and 4 brief generalized seizures. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of marked
diffuse cerebral dysfunction and profound cortical excitability and in a patient with post-anoxic
brain injury indicate low likelihood of full neurological recovery.  These findings were conveyed to
the neurology consult team and to the primary team at the time of the recording.  Patient will be
placed on a long-term EEG monitoring.

INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically adequate study.  Hyperventilation was not possible, but photic stimulation was completed.  The patient was quite somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The abnormalities include an asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres.  The left hemisphere is higher amplitude and the right hemisphere is lower voltage and more suppressed.  There are bursts of rhythmic, generalized delta.  In addition, there are bursts of more focal delta, maximum in the left frontal region.  Some of the left frontal delta somewhat sharply contoured.  An intermittent alpha rhythm of 7 hertz emerges.
The patient is somewhat confused, but answers questions with some detail, although some of the details are incorrect.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in bursts of rhythmic delta.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.

INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system with one channel EKG.  The patient is intubated, but responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG is markedly abnormal, but demonstrates a continuous pattern.  The overall pattern is relatively suppressed from the right hemisphere with smaller amounts of alpha and theta frequency activity.  From the left hemisphere, arrhythmic delta activity was noted with occasional sharp waves noted in the left hemisphere including left mid temporal or central regions.  These are medium amplitude sharp waves.  There is also a small amount of wicket noted from the left.  This record does capture some drowsiness with an increase in beta frequency activity.  When the patient is more active, there is a bit more muscle noted.
Heart rate:  98 BPM to 112 BPM, faster heart rate when the patient is a little bit more active.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due:
Generalized background slowing.
An asymmetry with significant disruption of faster frequency activity on the right.
Intermittent attenuations noted, which are asymmetric, more remarkable from the right.
Occasional sharp waves noted from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter, but more significantly involving the right hemisphere with more significant disruption of activity from the right.  The sharp waves are relatively blunted in nature, but in this individual with bihemispheric stroke, raise some potential for seizures.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was a technically acceptable EEG with impedances below 5 kilohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the EEG is well organized.  There is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Somewhat irregular mixed theta delta was noted in the frontal central regions. It is present bilaterally, but is somewhat more prominent in the right hemisphere.
Hyperventilation was performed early on in the record and very quickly produces a feeling in the patient of dizziness and jitteriness.  Bursts of frontal theta are noted, somewhat irregular and a little bit more prominent on the right in hyperventilation.  Photic stimulation was performed immediately after hyperventilation, in the early parts of the record and did elicit a driving response.  The patient remained quite anxious and there is a great deal of muscle artifact noted in the background.  In this challenging EEG with a great deal of muscle artifact, there appears to be an underlying 4 hertz spike and wave complex, typically seen in the right hemisphere sometimes with a bihemispheric predominance.  Review of the video identifies no twitching of the patient during the discharges.
Heart rate:  66 bpm.  Frequent PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent rhythmic somewhat irregular theta delta noted in relaxed wakefulness, and somewhat accentuated by hyperventilation.
In this technically challenging EEG, likely an underlying spike and wave complex seen a bit more prominently in the right hemisphere, but sometimes of bilateral representation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to a previous study 5 years ago, the patient had 3-5 hertz frontally predominant spike and wave activity as well as right frontal spike and wave activity and right
focal slowing.  Because of the degree of muscle artifact, these findings are not as well identified.  Additional evaluation of the patient regarding the tremulousness and PVCs may be of value.

SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse
background slowing are seen.
There are normal stage I sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves. Stage II sleep transients, including sleep spindles and K-complexes were not captured.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a technically challenging bedside record because of the patient's fragile skin.  The patient was relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION THE RECORD:  Much of the record includes a drowsy state with a mixed frequency background, with generous beta and smaller amounts of theta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in delta.  There are a handful of bursts of shifting irregular delta.  Rare spontaneous arousals are noted with auditory and tactile stimulation using a brief arousal glimpse of a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.

December 14th with traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage, skull

Now, with right upper gaze deviation.



MEDICATIONS:  Keppra. No others listed.



INTRODUCTION:  Twenty four minute digital video EEG was performed

at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement

with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated, but was


examined during the EEG.  There was no record of the use of

sedative, hypnotic medications in the report provided by the

technologist.



DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a medium

amplitude pattern with a mixed frequency pattern.  There are


lower voltage theta and delta frequency activity.  Intermittent,




subtle attenuations were noted, with attenuation or at least a

decrease in amplitude of the background.  These effects last 1 to


3 seconds and are not entirely a burst suppression pattern.  In

the sections of the record with more vigorous cerebral activity,


there is right frontal delta.  There is also a lower voltage

right frontal fast wave or lower voltage frontal sharp wave noted

intermittently.  Rare left frontal sharp waves were also noted.

Tactile stimulation of the patient seem to produce an attenuation


of cerebral activity lasting 7 seconds in duration.



Heart rate 144 bpm.


IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:

1. A low voltage slow pattern.


2. Intermittent attenuation of the background.

3. The phenomenon of attenuation of the background with tactile


stimulation.

4. Intermittent sharp waves noted from either frontal region,

right greater than left.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  The

epileptiform features noted were in the region of the previous


cranial defect and may have been accentuated by that fact.  In

the absence of the use of sedative, hypnotic medications, the

background described above is a worrisome pattern.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.  Patient seems to be
excessively drowsy



EEG BACKGROUND:

In maximal wakefulness  waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha
and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior
gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  There are multiple epochs with early
drowsiness with slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm to approximately 7 Hz.  Additional features
of drowsiness including shifting slowing, more notably within bit more focal slowing on the left.
Additionally, very early in drowsiness, bursts of rhythmic frontal high amplitude delta 3-4 seconds
duration were noted






Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with POSTS synchronous and symmetric vertex
waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present. Shifting  focal slowing is present. L>R


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.

TECHNIQUE:



A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a medium voltage 9-10 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR) which was asymmetric, better developed on the left. Low voltage frontally
predominant beta activity was seen bilaterally. Continuous medium amplitude irregular 2-4 Hz
activity was seen on the right, predominantly over the temporal and central regions. Occasional sharp
transients were seen in the right mid temporal region at T4.





During brief periods of drowsiness, voltage attenuation, fragmentation of the posterior dominant
rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Occasional (1/hour to <1min) sharp transients at T4 were seen.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 56 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Continuous irregular right central and temporal slowing.

2. Infrequent sharp transients in the right temporal region at T4.

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically difficult record
due to abundant muscle artifact. The study included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
mostly theta with superimposed alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 6-7 Hertz
posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and
amplitude is present but suboptimal.




Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



Mild-moderate generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.




HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild-moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization




CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of a mild-moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.

TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: produces an increase in amplitude of the background



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
