CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient is a 17-year-old man with a chief complaint of dizziness, lightheadedness, numbness mostly in the arm.  These episodes started over 6 months ago and occur approximately 1-2 times a week.  He has a history of 2 concussions, last 04/11/2013.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Conditions of the Recording:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness, the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and bursts of theta are captured.
Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort and results in no significant change in the background.
Photic stimulation does not result in occipital driving.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 27-minute EEG. No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinical suspicion for seizures persists, a repeat study with stage 2 sleep may be of benefit.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
MEDICATIONS:  Versed, Ativan, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with single lead of EKG.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded while he is unresponsive and no normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures are performed.  The patient is stimulated during the recording and there appears to be some muscle artifact and mild reactivity to the EEG.  Overall, the background consists of delta, low amplitude delta slow waves with intermittent bursts of theta and some focal slowing which are described beyond normal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal slow waves seen intermittently over the right hemisphere, maximal at C4/T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz, amplitude of 20 microvolts.
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz, amplitude 20 microvolts, occurring continuously with intermixed theta slowing seen infrequently.  Again, there is some reactivity to this EEG.
Heart rate:  90.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized slowing, as well as some right central temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right centrotemporal region which is consistent with a known tumor.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology, but may be due at least in part to medication effect.  No seizures or clear epileptiform discharges were seen.

INTRODUCTION:  The is a digital video EEG performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulations were performed.  This is a study that was captured during short periods of wakefulness as stage I and stage II of sleep, and short periods of REM.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In most awake state, posterior dominant rhythm is 9 Hz in frequency, and is reactive, and is located in posterior region.  Low amplitude frontocentral beta activity is distributed symmetrically.  Stage 1 sleep is characterized by vertex waves and POSTS.  Stage 2 sleep is characterized by sleep spindles and K complexes.  There is short periods of REM sleep that is characterized by rapid eye movements.  Photic stimulation induces driving response and hyperventilation induces mild symmetric slowing.  There are no seizures or epileptiform discharges seen in this study.
Heart rate is 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG and no seizures or epileptiform discharges are seen.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If clinical concern is for seizures, a prolonged EEG with sleep deprivation is recommended.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of recurrent pituitary tumor.  He had one seizure in 2004, subsequently pituitary tumor removal.  He now presents with a second seizure.  The seizure is  characterized by headache, body shaking with several second loss of consciousness.  The patient is aware of his seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include levothyroxine, Lipitor, Prilosec, metoprolol, losartan, aspirin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, symmetrical POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured.  Hyperventilation is performed with variable effort and does not result in a significant change in the background.  Step photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a heart rate of fewer than 60 beats a minute with occasional premature QRS complexes.
FINDINGS:
Stage 2 sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
Bradycardia and occasional premature QRS complexes.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 27-minute EEG.  Lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 28-year-old man with an episode of seizure versus syncope.  The patient felt like an anxiety attack.  He took a deep breath and lost consciousness.  Apparently there was twitching in both hands, eyes, and face, lasting less than a minute.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for anxiety and asthma.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Prevacid.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is according to the standard 10/20 system with additional T1-T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were
not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consisted of well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness, posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and there is an increased amount of theta.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and results in mild diffuse symmetrical background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a heart rate of approximately 60 beats per minute.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 29 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinical diagnosis of the seizures persist, a repeat study with stage 2 sleep may be of benefit.

HISTORY:  A 32-year-old man with anxiety, feels that he could not breathe and lost consciousness, had 3 events of hyperventilation with arms and legs flexing, arched back, responsive during the event, has a history of HIV, anxiety, asthma and hepatitis C.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  The patient is moving frequently throughout the recording and apparently as per the tech there is difficulty placing the electrodes on the patient due to agitation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10-11 Hz which is reactive to eye opening. There is diffuse frontocentral beta seen throughout the recording.  The background reveals this high frequency theta-delta mix frequency discharge at T6 which appears to be mainly artifactual and does not appear to evolve, although sometimes appears slightly suspicious.  Throughout the recording, the patient is moving which makes the evaluation of the recording difficult.  The patient appears to become drowsy but not clearly going to sleep.  Also on the video, he continues his moving and hyperventilating and coughing throughout the record.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy EEG. The T6 discharge at times appears suspicious but most likely is due to an electrode artifact.  Repeat a recording with some more sedation may be helpful in elucidating and clarifying the diagnosis.  This was discussed with the primary team.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the lab using the standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to T1 and T2 electrodes and 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 9-10 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  A stage 1 sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and posts.  Stage 2 sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  Hyperventilation results in symmetrical slowing of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate was 60 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
This is an awake and asleep record.  This is a technically acceptable record, although T1-T2 impedances were slightly above 5 kohms.  There is a fair amount of muscle artifact in wakefulness.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz, 30 microvolt alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements and an  increase in beta with transitions in and out of sleep.  There is also some rhythmic central theta, and in sleep electrode artifact was observed at T4.
Photic stimulation was remarkable for artifact and scant, supra-harmonic driving.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
In the transition to drowsiness, there was a single, subtle left temporal transient.
Heart rate 72 bpm.  Rare PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  This is a technically challenging, but normal EEG in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive epileptiform features were noted.  There was a single, subtle, left temporal sharp wave.  In that there is only 1 sharp wave, this must be considered artifact.  A repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep may be of value to more definitively characterize this patient's epileptiform activity.

The patient recalls having chest pain. Flushing and palpitations and then became amnestic.
MEDICATIONS: Losartan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake an asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. There 1s intermittent, temporal theta noted in relaxed wakefulness. Hyperventilation produced scant bilateral theta. This is followed by a drowsy pattern with attenuation of the alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation elicited brief bilateral driving.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits for an adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were noted in this record. An adult of this age is permitted a small amount of temporal theta as described above.

Currently, seizure-free for 2 years but has a feeling as if her left leg is moving, as if there is something inside of her leg, associated with leg pain.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Zoloft, Requip, insulin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a technically satisfactory, routine, greater than 20 minute EEG with photic stimulation.  This is a primarily awake record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates an awake pattern with a patient who appears anxious with frequent muscle movement.  A 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm was identified.  Abundant lambda was noted.
Photic stimulation elicited vigorous bilateral driving.  Heart rate 110 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG primarily in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The vigorous driving described above was noted in the 2006 EEG.  This is the 2nd, normal EEG for this adult.

MEDICATIONS:  Elavil, albuterol, Naprosyn.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.  It is technically satisfactory with impedances under 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Alpha squeak was noted.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta, but sleep was not sustained.
Hyperventilation produced a small increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate: 55 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  In this individual with a history of head trauma there was no background slowing noted.
