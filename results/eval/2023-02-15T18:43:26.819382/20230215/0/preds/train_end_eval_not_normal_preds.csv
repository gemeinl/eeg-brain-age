CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 42-year-old woman who presents with episodes of losing time for the last 2 months or so.  The patient's companion reports that she also appears to have fluctuating mental status in the last several days.  Of note, yesterday the patient was found to have renal dysfunction.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for drug abuse, hepatitis, and migraines.
MEDICATIONS:  Methadone, Wellbutrin, gabapentin, Vistaril, Risperdal, Topamax, albuterol, and Advair.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic 9-10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  The posterior dominant rhythm is stable.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient that at times is weak as well.  Additionally, diffuse polymorphic theta, occasional delta, and FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity) are captured.  Occasional triphasic wave forms with anterior-to-posterior lag are noted.  Hyperventilation was performed with fair effort and does not result in significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation does not result in additional abnormalities.  A single sharp transient is noted over the right mid temporal region.  Sleep is captured and characterized by attenuation of the posterior dominant rhythm and bursts of delta and theta activity as well as some FIRDA-like wave forms.
FINDINGS:
Mild diffuse slowing.
FIRDA.
Triphasic wave forms.
Right temporal sharp transient.
No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 29-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and triphasic wave forms.  These findings indicate etiological and nonspecific mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, possibly toxic metabolic in etiology.  Triphasic wave forms are seen in various forms of encephalopathy.  FIRDA is seen in encephalopathy.  Increased intracranial pressure and deep white matter lesions.  A single sharp transient seen over the right temporal region is of unclear clinical significance.  The lack of epileptiform discharges does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent throughout.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG is diffusely slow, relatively low voltage and featureless.  As the tracing continues, there is an asymmetry with a little bit of greater suppression of faster frequency activity in the right hemisphere, particularly in the posterior quadrant.  Brief arousals are characterized by an increase in theta with the exception of the right posterior quadrant or right hemisphere.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing.
Asymmetry noted at times somewhat more intermittently with more slow, low voltage arrhythmic delta activity in the right hemisphere compared to the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both hemispheres but the attenuation of faster frequency (albeit only theta) on the right is congruent with a history of an acute process involving gray and white matter.

No report of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  GlucaGen, metoprolol, and others.  No anti-seizure medications listed.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel of EKG.  The patient was recorded on the stretcher.  He was not able to cooperate with testing.  Photic stimulation was completed but hyperventilation was not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Technical:  There is a fair amount of muscle artifact.  The EEG was recorded for 24 minutes in an attempt to reduce the muscle.
When the patient is not experiencing muscle artifact, the EEG is low voltage and featureless.  There is a suggestion of low voltage alpha frequency activity in the background with some 8 Hz activity.  There is also some low voltage theta.  The patient is not able to cooperate with testing to determine if there is an alpha rhythm.  The overall pattern is more of a low voltage alpha theta pattern of 6-8 Hz.  The patient is spastic and the technologist attempts to reposition the patient to reduce the muscle artifact without success.  Lateral rectus and lateral eye movement artifacts were noted.
Photic stimulation:  No photic driving response was identified.
Heart rate:  112 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to replacement of normal background with a low voltage mixed frequency pattern rich in alpha and theta frequency activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  In terms of assessing the patient's interactivity with the environment, this EEG was not successful at doing so.  If seizures are an important consideration a more prolonged tracing capture in sleep might be of value.  Alternatively, evoked potentials may play some prognostic role in this clinical scenario.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Depakote, Dilantin, Lyrica, Crestor.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system with one channel EKG.  The patient was awake.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates an asymmetric pattern.  The right hemisphere is low voltage, with a mixture of beta and theta.  The left hemisphere demonstrates a breach rhythm with high amplitude slowing.  Epileptiform activity is noted with variability in terms of maximum including T3, T5 and O1.  The epileptiform activity reaches amplitudes of greater than 100 microvolts at times.  The epileptiform waxes and wanes.  It does not have clear frequency evolution as might be seen in a typical seizure but the pattern described above certainly does have evolution, although it never really slows or completely stops.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Essentially continuous epileptiform activity from the left posterior quadrant with some frequency evolution.
A high amplitude slow pattern on the left.
A somewhat slow pattern on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is compatible with a late ictal or postictal pattern.  Given the nature of the epileptiform activity described above and the clinical history, this pattern may represent an ongoing ictal, late status epilepticus pattern.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilantin, Depakote, phenobarbital, versed, and Decadron.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  The recording was performed continuously at the patient's bedside.  Video capability was activated.  Nursing staff notes and medical staff notes were reviewed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  There is isolated left anterior hemispheric asymmetry with slow wave forms and a high amplitude over the left hemisphere.  The background over the right hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic low-to-moderate amplitude, mixture of theta and delta activity.  The background over the left hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta mixed with continuous approximately 1 Hz semi-rhythmic and rhythmic sharp waves with after-going slow waves with maximum scalp negativity over T5 and L1 electrodes.  As the recording progresses, amplitude periodicity and frequency of the discharges becomes less pronounced.  Diffuse periods of discontinuity as well as increasing degree of bursts of diffuse beta are captured.  Occasional left posterior quadrant electrographic seizures are captured.  Frequency of these seizures decreases as the recording progresses.  A left side electrographic seizure is calculated at approximately 2:16 p.m.  Seizure starts with approximately 1 Hz rhythmic sharp waves with after-going slow waves with rapidly decrease in amplitude and evolved into the sharply contoured theta activity with embedded 2 Hz sharp waves with after-going slow waves.  This activity evolves into approximately 2.5-3 Hz sharply contoured delta activity with under-riding faster frequencies and spreads throughout the left hemisphere.  That seizure was approximately 40 seconds.  No normal sleep architecture is observed.
FINDINGS:
Occasional left posterior quadrant focal brief electrographic seizures that decrease in frequency as the recording progresses, with left __________ seizure at approximately 2:16 p.m.
Continuous left posterior quadrant rhythmic and semi-rhythmic epileptiform discharges (rather than quasi PLEDs) that decrease in frequency, amplitude, and as the recording progresses.
Moderate diffuse background slowing with period of discontinuity, degree of which fluctuates throughout the recording.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 20-hour continuous audio EEG monitoring due to occasional left posterior quadrant seizures and continuous left posterior quadrant semi-periodic and periodic epileptiform discharges that decrease in frequency and periodicity as the recording progresses.  These findings indicate underlying focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology and is consistent with this patient's history of recent tumor resection.  Diffuse background slowing indicates etiology for nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction and is consistent with this patient with a history of medication use.  Diffuse excess beta could be secondary to medication effect such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.

MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were  performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude, 10.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, symmetrical vertex waves are captured.  Occasional polymorphic theta and delta activity is observed over bitemporal regions; this activity occurs independently.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and accentuates bitemporal slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving and multiple flash frequencies.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of seizures for approximately 1 year.  Seizures are characterized as a loss of awareness with associated rhythmic left thumb/left hand movements.  These episodes last up to 45 minutes with post-ictal period lasting for approximately 20 minutes.  No associated falls and no generalized tonic/clonic convulsions.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal 300 mg b.i.d., Namenda, Aricept, Synthroid, metoprolol, Lipitor, and furosemide.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10 to 10.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and theta activity becomes more prominent.  Intermittent shifting theta and delta activity is observed over the bitemporal regions.  This activity is more pronounced over the right temporal region.  A single sharp wave with after-going slow wave is captured over the right anterior temporal region with a phased reversal of F8/T4 electrodes.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving with multiple flash frequencies.  A single EKG lead demonstrates an irregular heart rate.
FINDINGS:
Shifting mild to moderate bitemporal slowing, right greater than left.  A single sharp wave with after-going slow wave over the right anterior temporal region, with phased reversal of F8/T4 electrode.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 25-minute EEG due to shifting mild to moderate intermittent bitemporal slowing and a single right anterior temporal epileptiform discharge.  Some degree of temporal slowing is considered normal in patients over the age of 65, however, this recording demonstrates a high degree of slowing.  There is a potential epileptic focus emanating from the right anterior temporal region.  Focal bitemporal slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 65-year-old woman who presents after a 10 to 15 minute PEA code with subsequent hypothermia protocol.  The patient remains comatose.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Demerol, famotidine, atorvastatin.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed at the patient's bedside.  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system of with the addition of T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of intermittent generalized, frontally predominant, 2 Hz sharp waves with after going slow waves that occur in bursts of variable duration.  When these discharges resolve the background consists of relatively monomorphic, frontally predominant delta activity.  Additionally periods of diffuse background discontinuity are present.  Intermittent diffuse EMG artifact is captured.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG  lead demonstrates a heart rate of approximately 120 beats per minute.
FINDINGS:
Severe diffuse slowing.
Frontally predominant bilateral intermittent sharp waves with after going slow waves (Bi-PEDs).  No clear electrographically seizures.
Sinus tachycardia.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 21 minute electroencephalogram due to moderate diffuse slowing and frontally predominant generalized periodic epileptiform discharges without clear evolution into electrographic seizures.  These findings indicate etiological nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction, likely partially related to anoxia in this case.  In a patient status post anoxic brain injury this electroencephalogram pattern is consistent with a lower chance of full neurological recovery.  These findings were conveyed to the Neurology consultants.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake.  Activating procedures could not be performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  The patient is agitated and moving throughout the whole recording despite Ativan and despite technical efforts to keep him still, which caused a very poor quality EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Again, this is a limited EEG and the record reveals background consists of no normal posterior dominant rhythm and frontocentral beta.  Overall there is generalized slowing in the delta frequency and 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.  The patient again was agitated throughout the recording.  There was marked muscle artifact and multielectrode artifact throughout the recording.  No epileptiform activity can be seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  As stated above, generalized slowing.

The patient was treated with hypothermia.  History of hyperlipidemia, gout, and anxiety.
MEDICATIONS:  Fentanyl drip, Decadron, antibiotics, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Impedances were acceptable with the exception of T1 and T2 electrodes.  The patient was intubated, comatose, but not hypothermic.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage, but continuous, pattern with delta and smaller amounts of theta and beta.  There is a slight asymmetry in that there is a little bit more slowing on the right compared to the left.  Occasional lower voltage bursts of frontal delta were observed.
Tactile stimulation of the patient on one occasion produced a slight attenuation of the background, but on another occasion produced an increase in theta.
Heart rate:  60 BMP.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Intermittent attenuations in the background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  For this individual 48 hours status post cardiac arrest there are positive prognostic features in that this is a continuous EEG with smaller amounts of theta.  In addition, reactivity was noted.  If clinically indicated, a follow up EEG may be of value, but overall the presence of a continuous EEG with reactivity is a positive prognostic finding.  In addition, in that this is a patient who was sedated, the findings described above should be interpreted with caution.

There were occasional muscle twitch artifacts noted.  As the recording continues, the patient was a bit more responsive with eye movement.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern with mixed-frequency activity including low-voltage delta, occasional bursts of frontal delta, generous beta and small quantities of theta.  Tactile stimulation and auditory were associated with increase in faster frequency activity.  These are single sharply contoured transient and are in the left frontal region noted on only one occasion.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the background rhythm was slow in theta and delta frequencies.  There was an asymmetry of activity in parasagittal and temporal region with activity being of faster frequency with higher voltage on the left cerebral hemisphere most pronounced in T5/T3 with polymorphic theta and delta sharply contoured discharges.  There was breach rhythm seen at the left mid and posterior temporal and left central region.  There were occasional sharp wave discharges in frontotemporal region with no evolution.  Drowsiness was characterized by further slowing of the background and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies with no abnormal responses.  Heart rate was 90 to 100 beats per minute with occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to:
No posterior dominant rhythm.
Generalized slowing of the background activity in theta and delta range.
Polymorphic theta and delta activity at the left frontotemporal and central region.
Occasional sharp waves seen arising from the left frontotemporal region.
Left breach rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Diffuse slowing of the background activity during wakefulness could be due to toxic, metabolic, or infectious encephalopathy, effect of sedating medication or bilateral cerebral dysfunction.  Breach rhythm is consistent with the patient's history of craniotomy.  Almost continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity seen at the left temporal region suggesting of an underlying structural abnormality in the subcortical white matter of the left hemisphere.  The sharp waves seen arising from the left frontotemporal region are suggestive of epileptogenicity in the left cerebral cortex. There were no electrographic or clinical seizures seen during this recording.  Note that the patient was tachycardic with occasional PVC.

The background activity was low and attenuated in theta and delta range.  No clinical changes are reported with these electrographic seizures.  Heart rate was 60-90 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing the patient in a comatose state due to:
Partial nonconvulsive status epilepticus with seizures originating from the right temporoparietal region.
Right periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges.
Diffuse slowing of background activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Frequent seizures are due to the increased hyperexcitability of the underlying brain in the right cerebral hemispheres and are consistent with partial nonconvulsive status epilepticus.  Diffuse slowing of the background activity could be seen in severe toxic, metabolic, anoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to bilateral cerebral dysfunction or the effect of medications.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Protonix.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed at the bedside.  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  There is right to left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms at high amplitudes over the right hemisphere.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the left hemisphere consists of well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude of 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly over the left hemisphere.  Over the right hemisphere the posterior dominant rhythm reaches 8.5 Hz alpha activity, but it is unstable and polymorphic.  There is no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient over the right hemisphere.  The background over the right hemisphere consists primarily of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity.  Slowing is especially pronounced over the right frontotemporal region.  Additionally, rhythmic non-evolving 1 Hz prevalent delta runs observed over the posterior right quadrant.  These runs did not have either temporal or spatial evolution, and unlikely to represent electrographic seizures.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Periods of quiescence are captured, however, normal sleep relaxation is not observed.
FINDINGS:
Continuous moderate right hemispheric slowing most pronounced over the frontotemporal region.
Rhythmic and non-evolving 1 Hz delta activity observed over the right posterior quadrant unlikely representing an electrographic seizure.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 22 minute EEG due to continuous focal right hemispheric slowing that is especially pronounced over the right frontotemporal region.  This finding indicates focal cerebral dysfunction likely structural in etiology, and in this patient is consistent with a history of right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and a craniectomy.  No clear electrographic seizures are captured.

Seizures began while he was watching television.  Last seizure June 27. Seizures characterized by eye blinking, swallowing, loss of consciousness, convulsive activity and confusion.  The patient is unclear as to how often he has these seizures but notes that flashing lights exacerbate them.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was an awake through stage II sleep record in a patient who was quite sleepy. Photic stimulation was repeated during the EEG and cognitive testing was completed.  Impedances and technical aspects were acceptable.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is very drowsy with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm, generous low voltage, frontocentral beta.  He quickly transitioned from wakefulness to stage II sleep with generous beta followed by vertex waves, K-complexes, and spindles and POSTS.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in beta.
Photic stimulation elicited driving, superharmonic driving and a photo- paroxysmal response.  __________ can be seen as early as 1 Hz with superharmonic driving at 3 Hz.  Epileptiform activity was noted as early as the 7 Hz stimulation with a high amplitude burst of paroxysmal spike and wave activity with polyspike and wave activity.  Typical frequencies include 3 to 5 Hz and the spike and wave activity is typically under a second in duration.  This can be followed by lower voltage spike and wave activity in the occipital regions.  It seems to be a little bit more rapid on the right than the left when reviewed with an average reference.  This pattern of lower voltage spike and wave activity was seen at 7 Hz but consistently at the  faster frequency bursts.
Most bursts of paroxysmal epileptiform activity were less than 2 seconds.  Using a referential montage, they seemed to be maximum at the bin line but sometimes the polyspike activity is a little bit more prominent on the right.  The patient was given a reading task.  No interruption in reading was noted during the brief bursts, none of which were longer than 3 seconds.
An additional interictal epileptiform activity included a generalized  spike and wave discharge superimposed upon a vertex wave which was a little bit maximum to the left.
Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
A photo- paroxysmal response with spike and wave activity at 7 Hz and above.
A single generalized discharge noted in stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  On the whole, the features described above are relatively symmetric with polyspike and wave activity.  No impairment of awareness occurred with these events.  This EEG is most compatible with a generalized mechanism for epilepsy.  Plans were initiated to step up the patient's outpatient EEG appointment.

The patient had several episodes of body movements with no EEG correlation.
Heart rate was 90 BPM with occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:  Diffuse low amplitude slowing of background activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The diffuse slowing can have a wide range of differential diagnosis and could be seen in postictal states, (toxic-metabolic abnormalities, infectious, or bilateral cerebral dysfunction). Clinical Correlation recommended. There are no epileptiform discharges in this EEG, but this does not exclude the possibility of intermittent seizure activity.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a somewhat slow and disorganized background for age with alpha rhythm that reaches 7.5 Hz and reactive to eye opening.  There is sharply contoured slowing on T1 more than T2 region.  Drowsiness is characterized by increased slowing and decreased muscle activity.  Stage II of sleep is characterized by K complexes and spindles.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation, which wakes the patient up and increases muscle activity.
Heart rate is 72.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Slow and disorganized background and somewhat slow for age.
Sharply contoured slowing more on T1 than T2.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild left temporal slowing and somewhat slowing in the right temporal region.  The slowing could be due to the cerebral dysfunction, which can be explained by the previous stroke.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen on this EEG.

MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, vancomycin, many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated, occasional eye movements, not interactive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  From the right hemisphere, it is markedly slow and featureless with scant delta and theta noted in the frontal regions.  A similar pattern is noted on the left, but there is a bit more cerebral activity with a bit more theta on the left compared to the right.  Intermittent, bilateral attenuations were noted.  Frontal eye movement artifact was noted.  Occasional bilateral frontal delta was also observed.
Heart rate 84 BP.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:.
Marked background slowing.
Superimposed focal slowing from the right hemisphere.
Absence of clear reactivity or variability.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a severe underlying disturbance of cerebral function.  The EEG is significantly slower on the right than the left, congruent with the large stroke but both hemispheres are markedly slow and there is intermittent bilateral attenuation supportive of a bihemispheric process.  No epileptiform features were seen.  These findings are associated with a worrisome prognosis.

INTRODUCTION:  Conditions of the recording:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
HISTORY:  The patient is a 90-year-old woman who presents with an episode of speech arrest and generalized weakness.  The patient was also noted to have shaking in both upper extremities as well as confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include potassium, heparin, Keppra, aspirin.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  Throughout the recording, the patient rapidly transitions between wakefulness and sleep.  During maximal arousal, the posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic 7-8 Hz theta activity.  PDR is overall unstable and the PDR is poorly formed over the left hemisphere.  The anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient is very weak.  The background primarily consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity.  During sleep, the amount of delta increases and spindle like low amplitude waveforms are observed.  There is paucity of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  No clear electrographic seizures are observed.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Moderate focal left hemispheric slowing.
No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and asleep 22-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing that is more pronounced over the left hemisphere.  Diffuse slowing indicates etiologically non-specific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal left hemispheric slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possible structural in etiology, including the post ictal EEG pattern.  No electrographic seizures were captured.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using the standard international 10/20 system of electrode placement in addition to 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness only.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 6-7 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is 5-6 Hz diffuse theta activity seen during wakefulness, which is distributed symmetrically.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  There are intermittent bursts of left mid temporal slowing during wakefulness consisting of 5-6 Hz theta activity lasting for 2-3 seconds.  Heart rate was 70 beats per minutes and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to:
Diffuse slowing of the background with theta activity seen during wakefulness.
Slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
Left temporal slowing seen during wakefulness.  There are no epileptiform activity or electrographic seizures noted during this recording.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings could be due to metabolic, toxic, hypoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of sedating medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  The left temporal slowing could be suggestive of an underlying structural abnormality in the left hemisphere or left temporal dysfunction.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record.  No seizures were captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.  If clinically indicated, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or continuous bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  The recording is performed utilizing the standard 10/20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.   Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The recording was reviewed at least once during the 24-hour period by the attending neurologist.  The patient was equipped with an event button.  Nursing staff notes and medical staff notes were reviewed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low amplitude 9-10 Hz alpha activity that accentuates with eyes opening.  There is anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, symmetrical sleep spindles systems in the vertex phase are noted.  Continuous polymorphic theta activity sharply contoured is noted over the right temporal region.  Additional rounds of somewhat monomorphic theta activity is noted in the bifrontal EEG leads.  Independent bilateral anterior temporal sharp waves with after going slow waves are observed.  They occur much more frequently over the right.  Phase reversal occurs over the F8/T2 and F7/T1 electrodes.
A single electrographic seizure is captured.  It occurs out of stage 2 sleep.  It is characterized by sudden diffuse voltage attenuation and appearance of fast activity especially in frontal leads.  After 6 seconds rhythmic delta activity is noted over the right anterior temporal region.  Similar activity is seen observed over the anterior left temporal region.  This rhythmic activity lasts approximately 20 seconds followed afterwards by diffuse delta activity that is prolonged.  Total duration of seizure appears to be approximately 2-1/2 minutes.  Clinically, the patient appears to wake up and have worsening of dystonic posturing of his right upper extremity as well as what appears to be head deviation possibly toward the right.  The video quality is not very clear.  The patient stays still until nearly the end of the seizure.  The seizure starts at 7:44:48 p.m.  The video EEG does not demonstrate patient pushing either event button or nursing call button.  Upon questioning the patient about the seizure the next day, the patient reported that he had a seizure on 08/06/2013 although he could not elaborate more about the timing of his seizure or what occurred during seizure.
FINDINGS:
Continuous mild-to-moderate right anterior temporal slowing to occasional independent bilateral anterior temporal sharp waves with after going slow waves, right greater than left, with phase reversal over after F8/T2 and F7/T1 electrodes.
A single electrographic seizure of unclear lateralization or localization is captured. Seizure duration is approximately 2-1/2 minutes.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 24-hour continuous audio video EEG monitoring, due to continuous mild-to-moderate right anterior temporal focal slowing, independent bilateral anterior temporal right greater than left epileptiform discharges and a single 2-1/2 minute seizure of unclear lateralization or localization, likely neocortical in onset.  These findings indicate focal cerebral dysfunction that is bitemporal in origin more so over the right anterior temporal region.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 53-year-old man status post cardiac resuscitation on 08/06/2013, who is now undergoing hypothermia protocol.  His current body temperature is 93.8 degrees.
MEDICATIONS:  Include propofol drip and Ativan and others.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording is performed according to the 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The recording was reviewed at least once during the recording by the attending physician.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  Early in the recording, diffuse EMG artifact is present that obscures multiple leads and limits the interpretation of the recording during those times.  The degree of EMG artifact decreases as the recording progresses, and stops altogether at approximately 9 p.m.  It is unclear why EMG artifact is disappears since no notation is made on the EEG recording, however, it is possible that the patient might have received a paralytic agent.  The background consists of bursts of polymorphic theta and delta activity that are low in amplitude admixed with a period of background discontinuity.  As the recording progresses, bursts of activity shorten and periods of discontinuity increase and the patient finally reaches the burst to suppression ratio.  As the recording progresses, the burst to suppression ratio interval increases gradually, and bursts become shorter and less well formed.  At approximately 6:25 a.m., rhythmic diffuse activity is noted on the EEG.  Based on the video view, it appears to correspond to possible CPR administration.  It discontinues until about 6:47 a.m.  Once this CPR artifact stops, there is no discernible cerebral activity and there is also no heart rate that is picked on the single EKG lead.  Of note, prior to CPR, a single EKG lead demonstrated a heart rate of approximately 30 beats per minute.
FINDINGS:  Diffuse background slowing that increases gradually as the recording progresses.  No clear discernible cerebral activity after approximately 6:47 a.m.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 16 hour continuous video EEG monitoring due to worsening of background slowing and burst suppression that finally progressed to complete suppression of all background activity.  Sinus bradycardia is noted on a single EKG lead.  After 6:47 a.m., the EKG lead does not demonstrate any heartbeat.

An EEG is performed to rule out status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor, prednisone, Lovenox, metoprolol, and Protonix. The patient is not getting Versed.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to standard 10/20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single-EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of approximately 3 second bursts of variable amplitude polymorphic delta activity.  Bursts of activity are generally poorly formed over the right.  Inter-burst interval last approximately 4-7 seconds on average, thus making burst suppression ratio approximately 1:1 to 1:3.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.  Independent bursts of polymorphic sharply contoured fast activity are captured over the left posterior temporal/posterior quadrant.  Four electrographic seizures are captured.  These seizures all differ electrographically.  The seizures occurred at approximately 11:48 a.m., 11:51 a.m., 12:03 p.m., and 12:38, and last approximately 1 minute 39 seconds, 1 minute 23 seconds, 1 minute 15 seconds, and approximately 3 minutes and 16 seconds, respectively.  First electrographic seizure starts with moderate amplitude sharply contoured fast activity emanating from the left posterior temporal region.  This activity rapidly evolves into approximately 2.5 Hz rhythmic delta that increases in amplitude and decreases in frequency and spreads to the bilateral occipital region.
Seizure number 2 starts over the left lateral leads either over the left posterior temporal region or left anterior temple region.  Seizure starts with a low amplitude discrete spikes with after-going slow waves that rapidly increase in frequency into the alpha range (approximately 11 Hz activity) and spread throughout the left temporal region and bilateral occipital regions.  This activity gradually decreases in frequency and increases in amplitude, and spreads throughout the left hemisphere.  By the end of the seizure, the seizure is characterized by approximately 1 Hz 0.3 second bursts of moderate amplitude, rhythmic, alpha activity.
Seizure number 3 is similar in appearance and evolution to seizure number 2, however, it starts over the right temporal region.
Seizure number 4 appears to start over the right anterior temporal/mid temporal region.  It starts with a 5 Hz small amplitude sharp waves with after-going slow waves that rapidly decrease in frequency.  As the seizure progresses it appears to stop over the right temporal region and start over the left posterior temporal region.  As the seizure progresses it is similar in appearance to seizure number 1.
There is no clear clinical correlation with any of the patient's seizures.  There is no clear reactivity to either noxious, tactile, or verbal stimuli.  An irregular heart rate is noted in the single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Burst suppression, with burst suppression ratio of approximately 1:1 up to 1:3.
Near lack of clear bursts over the right temporal region.
Four discrete electrographic seizures that differ in appearance and emanate from either left posterior temporal region, left anterior temporal region, and right anterior temporal region.
No clear evidence of reactivity.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal nearly 24-minute coma EEG due to  1:1 to 1:3 burst suppression, poorly formed bursts over the right temporal region, and 4 discrete electrographic seizures that differ electrographically and that arise from at least 3 distinct cerebral regions.  These findings indicate significant cerebral dysfunction  and if the patient is not sedative medications indicate a poor prognosis of a full neurological recovery.  These findings were conveyed to the Neurology consultant team at that time of the review.  The patient will be converted to the long term monitoring.

CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to standard the 10-20  system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The recording was performed at the bedside.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is right to left interhemispheric asymmetry.  The background over the left hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic, very well amplitude theta and delta activity admixed with prominent beta activity.  The background over the right hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic variable amplitude delta greater than theta as well as under riding faster activity admixed with moderate amplitude sharp waves with after going slow waves emanating from the right frontocentral region.  Phase reversal occurs over F8/F4/C4 electrodes.  There are several electrographic seizures throughout the recording, lasting on average approximately 1 minute.  These seizures are characterized by increase in frequency of sharp waves with after going slow waves observed over the right frontocentral region.  Seizures are characterized by a gradual increase in frequency of epileptiform discharges to approximately theta delta range and then gradually decreasing in frequency and stopping.  Additionally occasional periods of brief background discontinuity are noted.  It is not clear is these seizures have a clinical correlation; however, however on 1 occasion the EEG technologist notices the patient squints at the onset of seizure.

INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while slightly confused.  Activating procedures were not performed. Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software in addition to patient's notes and nurses events were used to review the EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Versed.
HISTORY:  A 68-year-old man with history of two generalized tonic-clonic seizures not following commands and right temporal contusion with traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage after a bicycle accident.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: There is some intermittent Cz electrode artifact seen intermittently throughout the recording as well as A1 electrode artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The record opens to a diffusely slow background with posterior dominant rhythm that at times can be seen best over the left hemisphere reaching 7-8 Hz; however, this background improves slightly over the last 10 hours and is slightly more continuous again seen best over the left hemisphere and reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontal central beta seen too especially over the left hemisphere and best at the last hours of the recording.  There is no normal sleep architecture; however, there is some wake and sleep stage changes that are noted.  Activating procedures were not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
1. Focal sharp waves seen at C4 in a pseudoperiodic pattern occurring almost at 1-2 Hz with some intermittent attenuation continuously throughout the recording consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLED's).
2. Focal sharp waves seen occasionally at F8/T4 in wakefulness and sleep.
3. Focal slow waves seen continuously at C4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
4. Moderate generalized slow waves.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right central periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges as well as right anterior temporal sharp waves in addition to focal slowing in the same region. There is also moderate diffuse generalized slowing.
HEART RATE:  84.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction and acute irritability over the right central region which is consistent with the known hemorrhage and contusion. In addition there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is non-specific with regards to etiology but may be due at least in part to medication effect. No seizures were seen. These findings were reported to the primary team.

The patient was recorded while comatose.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some EKG artifact seen throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reviewed based on a brain dead protocol at 2 microvolt sensitivity reveals no normal cerebral activity and lack of normal brain architecture.  There is no posterior dominant rhythm, no frontal central beta, absence of any sleep architecture, and no activating procedures were performed.  The patient did have stimulation and no reactivity or variability were seen.  Electrodes were checked by the technician during the recording.  This study lasted a totality of 53 minutes.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  No normal electrical cerebral activity.
SEIZURES:  None.
Heart rate is 96.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to the lack of any normal electrical cerebral activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with electrical cerebral findings and in the right clinical scenario is consistent with brain death.  These findings were communicated to the primary team.

She has episodes of losing time between 5 minutes to 2 hours.
MEDICATIONS:  Hydralazine, metoprolol, Neurontin, lovastatin, insulin, oxycodone, and amitriptyline.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG monitoring was performed in the EMU using the standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  An automated seizure and spike detection system and a patient activated alarm system were used.  Records were reviewed daily for EEG abnormalities and clinical events.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Interictal EEG from 08/12/2013 to 08/15/2013:  In the most alert state, there is a posterior dominant rhythm with frequency of 8.5-10.5 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is presence of frontal central low amplitude beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  A stage I sleep was characterized by disappearance of alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of eye blink and muscle artifact, as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves.  Stage II sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  Slow-wave sleep and REM sleep were also captured.  Focal slow waves seen rarely at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolt.
Clinical events:  On 08/14/2013 at 05:37 a.m., there was a push button event as the patient experienced 1 episode of missing time, slurred speech, disorientation.  There were no EEG ictal changes associated with this event.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG monitoring study due to rare left focal slowing at F7/T3.  Patient had 1 event as described above during this recording while she was awake and reports 1 episode of missing time with disorientation.  This event was associated with no ictal change on EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Focal slowing could be due to structural or functional dysfunction of underlying brain in the subcortical white matter in the left hemisphere.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  Patient had 1 event of missing time and disorientation for a few minutes with no EEG correlations.  This is one of the typical event that patient experiences as a seizure activity.  The capturing of missing time and confusion without any associated ictal change on EEG may be suggestive of a simple partial seizure since simple partial seizures are not always captured on scalp EEG or it could be suggestive of a nonepileptic event.  This EEG monitoring does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy since all of the patient's habitual events have not been captured.  If seizure remain a clinical concern, a repeat video EEG monitoring may be helpful.

There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation that produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen rarely at T4 during wakefulness.
Focal slow waves seen frequently at T4, at times appearance slightly monomorphic and independently at T3, both of them at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an   amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  Please note that at T3 there is electrode artifact which does affect the complete evaluation of the region.
HEART RATE:  66.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right mid temporal focal sharp waves and slowing as well as independent left mid temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a  diagnosis of localization of related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the right mid temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of bilateral independent mid temporal focal slowing (right more than left), which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.  Please note that these findings are similar to the ones on the EEG performed on 11/04/2009, where focal slowing was seen on the right, but no sharp waves were seen.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard International 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness and drowsiness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 9.5 to 10 Hz in frequency, seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reaches at best in a limited amount of time, a posterior dominant rhythm that gets to 9 Hz, which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  However, there is a lack of normal frontal central beta, and the overall background consists of theta frequency discharge at 5-7 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording.  The patient does appear to go to sleep, stage I, but no deeper stages of sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Excessive theta in wakefulness at 5-7 Hz at an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts seen almost continuously throughout the recording.
Heart rate 60.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.

The patient presented to the emergency room with unresponsiveness.  Previous stroke involving the right side with left hemi-neglect.
MEDICATIONS:  Coreg, lisinopril, Keppra, Plavix, aspirin, Coumadin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel  EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  The technologist noted that the patient came with braids.  Impedances were not optimal, but this is a technically acceptable record.
DESCRIPTION RECORD:  Despite the issues described above, the background EEG from the left hemisphere is well organized with a glimpse of a 10 Hz alpha rhythm and significant muscle artifact.  The right hemisphere demonstrates an alpha rhythm which is sometimes a bit disrupted.  More notable, is intermittent, somewhat rhythmic slowing with a mixture of theta and delta from the right hemisphere, maximum in the frontotemporal and centrotemporal regions.  As the patient becomes drowsy with slow rolling eye movements, the focal slowing on the right becomes more prominent.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing in the right hemisphere, intermittent.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Epileptiform features were identified.  The intermittent, focal slowing with disruption of faster frequency in underlying mixed theta/delta supports a structural process on the right involving gray and white matter.  If seizures are an important consideration a followup study may be of value.

MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, labetalol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated, poorly responsive and experiencing hiccups.  The patient was examined during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The overall pattern is quite slow.  There is an asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres.  From the right hemisphere, the overall pattern is slow delta with a paucity of faster frequency activity.  Occasional right central sharp waves are noted in the context of a breech rhythm.
The activity on the left is a bit more variable.  With tactile stimulation, some 7 Hz theta activity is identified in the posterior scalp regions.  When the patient is not stimulated, the EEG demonstrates a more diffusely slow pattern with a drop out of the theta previously noted on the left.  In addition, as the patient becomes drowsier, there are more bursts of generalized delta and some shifting, frontal delta a bit more so on the left compared to the right. This is a dynamic record from the left at times, with stimulation the patient awakens and there is a slow but present posterior dominant rhythm.  In sleep, bilateral higher amplitude, delta was noted
Heart rate: 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Essentially continuous focal slowing from the right hemisphere.
Rare right central sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural or functional process on the right involving gray and white matter.  Sharp waves were not prominent.  The left hemisphere demonstrates a clearly reactive pattern.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was noted to have a prominent parietal craniotomy scar.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 8.3 Hz alpha rhythm.  There are intermittent bursts of bilateral slowing with some arrhythmic delta activity.  This activity is more prominent in the right central parietal region.  In addition, this activity emerges a bit as the patient becomes drowsy.  Other features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha rhythm and an increase in background slowing.
In wakefulness, there is some subtle, underlying slowing in the posterior regions bilaterally, again right greater than left.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Mild slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Occasional bilateral slowing, more prominent in the right hemisphere.
Right central parietal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No sharp waves or seizures were identified.  The focal slowing described above is congruent with the patient's surgical history.  If epilepsy is an important consideration a repeat, more prolonged EEG may be helpful in search of epileptiform activity.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  This was an EEG that was at times technically challenging.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in rhythmic theta.  In the transition to sleep, there is some irregular sharply contoured theta noted from the right.  Some of this has the morphology of rhythmic midtemporal theta of drowsiness, but it is irregular.  Similar activity was noted on 1 occasion from the left.  Vertex waves, K complexes and spindles were noted in stage 2 sleep.  Snore artifact was noted in stage 2 sleep, producing an arousal.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving, as well as photoelectric artifact.

INTRODUCTION:  Routine digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not possible.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Prominent right posterior craniotomy defect was noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a high amplitude pattern with an asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres.  A posterior dominant rhythm of 7 Hz, 70 microvolts is noted on the right, but is not present on the left.  The left hemisphere is a bit more featureless, lacking in faster frequency activity with some sharply contoured delta and sharply contoured delta maximum at T5 sometimes with an underlying T5 sharp wave or spike.  This can be identified in wakefulness.  In later sections of the record, there is some more rhythmic theta picked up in the left occipital region, not clearly reactive to eye opening  with left occipital sharp waves.  In addition, in relaxed wakefulness, right parietal, P4 sharp waves emerge as the patient's alpha rhythm disappears.
At the end of the record, as the patient drifts off to sleep, the right parietal sharp waves become more prominent.  In addition, there are additional spikes noted in sleep, including FP1, as well as some fast activity in the left frontal region.
Photic stimulation did not elicit a driving response.
HEART RATE:  84 bpm.

Marked background slowing.
An asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres with more significant disruption of faster frequency activity in the left hemisphere relative to the right.
Epileptiform activity identified from several localizations including T5-P4, left frontal.
CLINICAL CORRELATE:  This EEG supports a localization related mechanism for epilepsy, although multiple different foci were identified.  In this individual with a right porencephalic cyst, there was a bit
more disruption of faster frequency activity on the left compared to the right and correlation with imaging may be of value.  No seizures were identified.

MEDICATIONS:  ASA, Aricept, others
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not possible but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is a bit slow and disorganized with a 7.5 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the background with slow rolling eye movements.  Occasional, isolated shifting slowing was noted.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.  Heart rate 78 bpm, occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG for adult of this age due to:
Slowing of the background rhythm.
Mild background disorganization.
Shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  The features described above are nonspecific and can be seen in the context of  dementia.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In the Jab using standard 10·20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed. This Is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness. there Is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm, but at times this Is clearly disrupted in the right occipital region compared to the left. As the patient becomes drowsy, in addition, there Is subtle focal rhythmic 3-4 Hz activity in the right posterior quadrant, which Is brief. not sustained.
Photic stimulation is obscured by muscle artifact, but no significant driving was identified.
Hyperventilation produces an increase In amplitude and subtly accentuates the asymmetry between the 2 temporal regions and the 2 occipital regions. Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This Is an abnormal EEG due to: Focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant characterized by disruption of the alpha rhythm in wakefulness and rare focal slowing in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this EEG. This pattern is improved compared to previous studies, which have demonstrated occipital sharp waves, spikes, and occipital seizures.

MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Xanax, others.
Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 1D-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This was a 1-hour EEG. It was a technically satisfactory study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm identified bilaterally with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta. Breach rhythm is noted with artifacts noted in the right frontotemporal region. Sharply contoured slowing is noted as the patient becomes drowsy.
Hyperventilation clearly accentuates focal slowing In the right hemisphere with sharply contoured slowing, primarily seen from the right, and rare sharp waves. Features of drowsiness include an increase In background slowing and of course accentuation of the focal slowing. There is disruption of faster frequency activity noted in the right frontal region in sleep. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This Is an abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intermittent focal slowing noted In the right hemisphere, particularly frontotemporal region
accentuated by hyperventilation and sleep.
2. Sharply contoured slowing and rare sharp waves maximum F8/T4.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are congruent with a past history of traumatic brain injury, and a focal mechanism for epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS: Cefuroxime, pantoprazole, others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside In ICU using standard 10.20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This was a technically acceptable EEG with impedances slightly elevated at T1· T2 electrodes. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow and disorganized. When the patient is stimulated with eye opening and eye closure, there Is primarily a theta frequency background with little in the way of arrhythmic delta but on other occasions, when the patient is unstimulated, there is very slow arrhythmic delta activity noted, perhaps more so on the right than the left. When the patient Is unstimulated, in this sharply contoured record, there are occasional sharp waves noted. These may be right central or left frontotemporal. Shifting asymmetries were noted, and at times there seems to be more disruption of faster frequency activity in the right compared to the left.
Heart rate Irregular 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. A markedly slow and disorganized pattern.
2. A shifting slowing with a bit more disruption of taster frequency activity on the right compared to the left.
3. Occasional sharp waves noted from either hemisphere with somewhat different localizations including left frontotemporal or right centrotemporal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function. No seizures were recorded and the sharp waves noted were infrequent. Evaluation for a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function is suggested.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is noted to have multiple cranial defect Including F8 and in the left hemisphere. Impedances are acceptable aside from T1-T2. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The background EEG from the right hemisphere is unremarkable with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm and generous, frontocentral beta activity. There is a scant amount of theta.
The left hemisphere demonstrates a prominent breach rhythm with head rocking artifact disruption of faster frequency activity in the frontal regions. and a epileptiform discharge which is typically maximum at T5, sometimes C3 in the context of a breach rhythm.
Hyperventilation was performed early in the record, accentuating the focal slowing. Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm and again accentuation of focal slowing this time at C3-
P3. Photic stimulation was performed while the patient Is drifting off to sleep and elicited scant driving.
Heart rate 4 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This Is an abnormal EEG clue to:
1. Essentially continuous focal slowing in the left hemisphere with variable maximum and different
features including attenuation of the faster frequency activity in the left frontotemporal region, and
more posterior slowing in sleep.
2. In the context of a breach rhythm subtle sharp waves at T5 and P3.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are congruent with a structural functional process on the left. The right hemisphere Is relatively unremarkable. No seizures were recorded. At this time, previous
EEGs were not available for comparison.

MEDICATIONS: LEV



INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is a technically acceptable routine, awake and asleep EEG capturing hyperventilation and photic stimulation. The background EEG is markedly abnormal. The overall

background Is slow and disorganized. In addition, focal, medium to high amplitude activity is noted with spikes noted at T6 and 02. In addition, left anterior temporal spikes were With stimulation, the patient alerts and there is more of a theta frequency background. The in the right occipital region persist. In addition, there are a handful of spikes In tile light anterior temporal region.



Hyperventilation was performed early on in the record with good effort II seems 10 accentuate tile focal slowing In tile light occipital region and the right occipital sharp waves. Drowsiness Is characterized by an Increase in background slowing. The epileptiform activity in the right occipital and left temporal region persists.



Photic stimulation does not elicit. a driving response. The t5 Hz stimulation may accentual. the epileptiform activity in the right occipital and light frontal and left anterior temporal regions.



At the close of the record, the patient transitions to stage 2 sleep with vertex waves and spindle$. The abundant epileptiform activity continues.



HEART 60 BPM



IMPRESSION: This Is an abnormal EEG due to:

1. A somewhat slow and disorganized background in wakefulness.

2. Abundant epileptiform activity. Right occipital, right frontotemporal and left anterior temporal.



CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports 8 complex epileptiform process. The epileptiform activity is noted in the right occipital and left frontotemporal regions. This pattern has been previously described for this individual. The bilateral background slowing is congruent with the CNS Insults that this patient has experienced. No seizures were recorded.

Seizures characterized by head turning to the left and rolling over. Characterized by staring. No tonic-clonic seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in he lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. In relaxed wakefulness. There Is intermittent focal slowing identified from the right mid to anterior temporal region. Although there Is some artifacts noted in the record including the EKG artifact. There discreet spikes in the right anterior temporal at F8, T2. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record and seems to accentuate the slowing noted from the right. This is followed by drowsiness, which again accentuates the focal and low to medium amplitude sharp waves and spikes from the right anterior temporal region. As becomes drowsy, some of the these lower voltage spikes become a little bit more in morphology and more sustained bursts of focal slowing and additional sharp waves are noted as the patient becomes drowsy with the sharp waves starting to develop into bursts or trains which are not sustained.

Unfortunately, photic stimulation is performed just as the patient Is starting to transition this sleep pattern and a scant driving response was noted.
Immediately after photic stimulation, the patient transitions into stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles and K complexes. The epileptiform activity was clearly accentuated by stage II sleep.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right temporal focal slowing.
2. Right anterior temporal sharp waves and spikes which are accentuated by and sleep.
CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. The findings described above support a focal mechanism for this patient's epilepsy. Additional EEG recording will be initiated to this individual seizure.
