DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is awake, alert, and interactive.  She is observed to have tremulousness of the arms and face in wakefulness without EEG change.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record with poor effort.  This increases the patient’s trembling including facial twitching and the patient is slow to respond, however, the EEG throughout the entire hyperventilation is normal.  During this one-hour EEG, the patient again experiences the arm and face trembling at 11:02.  The tech again performs testing.

In maximum wakefulness, the EEG appears to be reasonably well organized with a 9 Hz, 30 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in background beta activity.  There may be an area of very subtle accentuation of beta in the right centrotemporal region.  Vertex waves are seen in stage I sleep.  POSTS are noted in stage I sleep as well.  Vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles are seen in stage II sleep.  Stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.

TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:




The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During very drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with fair cooperation and produces
no effect.




Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 30 to 50 V posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In relaxed wakefulness and early drowsiness, there is rhythmic, 5 Hz, sharply contoured activity with a flat-top shape in the left temporal region.  This may appear in bursts lasting up to 1.5 seconds.  There is a very slight degree of variability in the activity.  Identical, 5.2 Hz activity is identified from the right in similar states.  This is also seen at the close of hyperventilation as the patient becomes drowsy.
Photic stimulation elicits symmetric driving at intermediate and faster flash frequencies.
HR:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This EEG is at the limits of normal in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No definite epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The findings described above are most compatible with a psychomotor variant.  They have the characteristic 5 Hz activity.  On the left, there is just a touch of variability in terms of actual frequency, but the identical activity is seen on the right in the same sleep state.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and


photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically


with eye opening.  Generous beta activity is noted


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Prominent wicket activity is identified, left greater than right



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:      Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic

stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric


photic driving, which is a normal finding.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. REg


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 9.5 Hz, 30 to 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background beta with vertex waves.  Spindles are seen in stage II sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is the second normal EEG for this individual.  The first was in 2004.  Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  Of note, in the last EEG, the patient had harmonic and subharmonic driving, which were not seen today.  This may be due to the fact that the patient was falling asleep in photic stimulation.  Given the patient’s history of seizures during sleep and the snoring and arousals from sleep identified here, perhaps a polysomnogram should be considered.

SEDATION: TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recording using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes was performed utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation .



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



There are normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes present during Stage II sleep. Slow wave sleep is not captured.

No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES :



Hyperventilation: was deferred, due to pulmonary issues Photic Stimulation: elicits minimal driving

evaluation. He reported to the technician that he is not taking


his medication correctly.


MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg ER capsule, Take  by mouth 3 times

daily.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:




A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta


activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 12 Hertz


posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes. Note

that patient was asleep during part of the stimulation.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.

SEDATION: none



TECHNIQUE:

A  1 hour Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and


photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.5

Hertz  55 uV posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  REM sleep WAS

captured.


The patient sometimes coughs in sleep, limited muscle artifact

was seen in sleep.

No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces mild diffuse symmetric

background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which


is a normal finding.  Patient was falling asleep


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep 1 HOUR EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.

REM sleep in a 1 hour EEG,albeit brief, may be correlated with


clinical history.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of


epilepsy.

The patient is recorded during wakefulness, stage I, stage II, and deeper stages of sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
Abnormal discharges:  None.
Patient events:  The patient had an event at 7:26 in the morning.  She pressed the alarm, laid in bed, and became unresponsive to any verbal or motor commands.  She continued to be unresponsive for about 3 minutes, after which the doctor came in and tested her.  She started crying and appeared to be slow to answer commands, but finally ended up answering commands.  She continued crying during this event.  During the entire event there was no abnormal EEG findings and remained as a normal awake EEG.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and sleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  The patient's event in which she was unresponsive had no EEG correlate.  As such, it is consistent with the diagnosis of nonepileptic psychogenic event.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The patient was poorly relaxed with a large amount of muscle artifact and frontal eye movement
artifact throughout the record. The waking demonstrates a large amount of generalized low to
medium amplitude 16-25 Hz activity and a small amount of low to medium voltage posteriorly
dominant 10-12 Hz rhythmic activity.  Posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) attenuates symmetrically with
eye opening.





Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:






Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 76 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10.5 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  There is a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is sharply contoured, almost rhythmic theta activity identified in the temporal regions left greater than right. This is accentuated by hyperventilation.  It has some of the stereotypic morphologies of a normal variant, but the frequency ranges from 3.6 to 7.1 and occurs in brief paroxysmal bursts.  The patient seems to be very drowsy, drifting off into stage I sleep with vertex waves.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.
HR:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This EEG must be considered outside the range of normal due to:
The rhythmic temporal theta activity, which does not have the characteristic frequencies of a normal variant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: While the activity described above is not specifically epileptiform in nature, it renders this EEG abnormal.  Additional recording may be important to determine if this activity improves over time, or may be associated with underlying epileptiform activity.  Of note, the patient was excessively drowsy and had difficulty completing hyperventilation.

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is frequently noted.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-
25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is
observed.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear
diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair effort, and produces no effect.  Stepped
photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple
flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a heart rate of ~ 60 bpm.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation and hyperventilation are performed.  In awakeness there is a low voltage, transverse posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage front and central beta.
DESCRIPTION OF  THE RECORD:  Features of drowsiness include slow eye rolling movements.  In early drowsiness there is a single, left temporal benign epileptiform . transient of sleep.  Hyperventilation is performed while the patient is drifting off  to sleep and does not activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.	Notable in this record are:  Some electrode artifacts including muscle or pickup at T3 at the close of the record.
HR:	96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were observed in this study. There was a single, normal variant. If further characterization of this patient's background EEG is needed, a more prolonged study capturing deeper stages of sleep may be of use, although it must be noted that this patient was quite drowsy throughout the EEG although she was not able to achieve stage II sleep.

Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record. Drowsiness is characterized
by slow rolling eye movements. The patient has some eyebrow twitching. The
technologist has an EMG channel for this. During awake EEG, the patient demonstrates
facial twitching. The technologist asked the patient ""Is this your typical seizure?"" The
patient answered yes, this is her typical seizure. The video demonstrates a little facial
twitching which produces artifact and the EEG demonstrates a normal awake pattern.
The facial twitching occurs later on in the record. Features of drowsiness include
attenuation of the alpha with rhythmic background slowing. Posts are observed. Photic

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 47 y.o. male with a history of episodic tingling in hands and head (last 1 mo
ago, but occur ""not often""), referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS: pt unable to recall



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5-9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Patient notes that his hands feel numb after
hyperventilation.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  The patient noted that his hands felt numb after
hyperventilation; no EEG correlate other than mild diffuse background slowing (an expected finding
after hyperventilation) was seen.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.

The patient noted that his hands felt numb after hyperventilation; no EEG correlate other than mild
diffuse background slowing (an expected finding after hyperventilation) was seen.




A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.

INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Patient is awake.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.
During this EEG the patient had a seizure. This was at 10-9-06 2006. He is lying comfortably with  a normal awake pattern. This is followed by jerking, hiccupping, and head moving from side to side. Asynchronous arm movements are noted, a little bit more so on the left arm. He turns
his head to the left, and he bounces back and forth. During the seizure a well-defined alpha
rhythm can be identified. As he rocks his head to the left, artifact is picked up on some of the scalp electrodes, but the alpha rhythm can still be seen despite the fact that he is moving about. The behavior after 43 seconds and the EEG demonstrates a normal pattern. Of note, he starts rocking his head to the right and looks to the left at the end of the event. The technologist calls the patient. He is unresponsive despite a normal awake EEG. Another event occurs at 10:10:09. He receives Ativan for the second behavior, which is not sustained.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and Photic stimulation are completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz 50 mV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record.  It does not activate the record. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.   A small amount of frontal theta is observed in drowsiness. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR:	60 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal nor epileptiform features are observed in this EEG. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy nor does it exclude a diagnosis of an underlying encephalopathy or mild cognitive disturbance.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and an excess amount of bifrontal beta activity,

organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening.



Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only routine EEG.  There are no clinical


or electrographic events reported or detected.

Excess beta activity may be seen in the setting of certain


medications such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

INTERVAL IMPRESSION AND CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This 1st 24 hours of video EEG monitoring was remarkable for a normal background in wakefulness through stage II sleep, but with 3 events without an EEG change.  The patient demonstrated impairment of awareness with the events suggesting that these events may be part of this patient's repetitive of anxiety-related seizures (nonepileptic seizures).

October 28 to October 29, 2914: During this section of the record, the patient experienced multiple nonepileptic seizures at times: 8:45, 9:48, 4:12 p.m., 6:27 p.m., 7 p.m., 8 p.m., 10:16 p.m., and midnight.

Background:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a symmetric reactive 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTs.

Interictal Epileptiform Detections:  None.

Pushbutton Events:  There are 8 push buttons, and event that occurred while the patient was unhooked. The patient described that tactile stimulation of her scalp produces the events that she experiences.  The events are experienced by the patient as being different but she is able to push the button for all events.  She is unresponsive.  She may moan, grimace and demonstrate automatisms in the right hand.  She is responsive during the events and while examined by the physician for the 8:47 a.m. event, follows commands, taking a deep breath and participating with the physical exam.  She does not recall the code word for any of the events.  She describes the events as feeling to her as if they are much different, Some of them feel to her as if she is just dropping out.  She is aware that tactile stimulation of the scalp can produce the events.

Normal EEG was  associated with all of these events.
Heart rate 66 bpm.

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG, seizure and spike detection software.

MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, topiramate, others.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:
October 27 to October 28
Background:  In wakefulness, the background includes a well-organized 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.
Epileptiform Detections:  None.
Patient Events:  There are 3 events at 6:51, 3:53 and 4:35.  The patient pushes the button for all of the events with the exception of 1 event when the nurse was present at 6:51.  She stares off into space, is verbally unresponsive, and does not identify a code word.  In the 1st event, she stares off into space and is poorly responsive followed by some chewing movements.  She is able to follow some commands during that event.  In the other 2 events, she demonstrates tapping movements of the right hand.  For all 3 events, the EEG demonstrates a normal background.

Heart rate 60 bpm.

INTERVAL IMPRESSION AND CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This 1st 24 hours of video EEG monitoring was remarkable for a normal background in wakefulness through stage II sleep, but with 3 events without an EEG change.  The patient demonstrated impairment of awareness with the events suggesting that these events may be part of this patient's repetitive of anxiety-related seizures (nonepileptic seizures).

October 28 to October 29, 2914: During this section of the record, the patient experienced multiple nonepileptic seizures at times: 8:45, 9:48, 4:12 p.m., 6:27 p.m., 7 p.m., 8 p.m., 10:16 p.m., and midnight.

Background:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a symmetric reactive 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTs.

Interictal Epileptiform Detections:  None.

Pushbutton Events:  There are 8 push buttons, and event that occurred while the patient was unhooked. The patient described that tactile stimulation of her scalp produces the events that she experiences.  The events are experienced by the patient as being different but she is able to push the button for all events.  She is unresponsive.  She may moan, grimace and demonstrate automatisms in the right hand.  She is responsive during the events and while examined by the physician for the 8:47 a.m. event, follows commands, taking a deep breath and participating with the physical exam.  She does not recall the code word for any of the events.  She describes the events as feeling to her as if they are much different, Some of them feel to her as if she is just dropping out.  She is aware that tactile stimulation of the scalp can produce the events.

Normal EEG was  associated with all of these events.
Heart rate 66 bpm.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed   in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement  with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and Photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   In wakefulness, there is a 10.8 Hz alpha rhythm of
50 to 70 meg with prominent eye movement artifact such as lateral rectus artifact. In addition, there is mu activity and temporal wicket. In hyperventilation and in a handful of occasions there is a suggestion of an underlying sharp wave in the left temporal region. Unfortunately this is the same area as remarkable for significant eye movement artifact and wicket, and some of the activity described above is clearly wicket. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Photic simulation elicits bilateral driving.

INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG  was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a 1 hour, sleep deprived, EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness  there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.  The patient transitions frequently from wakefulness  into stage 2 sleep with vertex waves I observed in stage 1 sleep.  Prominent wicket is observed bilaterally in early drowsiness.  Epochs of stage 1 and stage 2 are interrupted by snore arousals and other arousals and there is muscle artifact compatible with a bit of snoring, and some of that actually is seen just as he awakens spontaneously.  Photic stimulation elicits:  No driving today.

HR: 	60 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal nor epileptiform features were observed in this record.  Normal variants, such as wicket were observed.   In addition, snore artifact also produced some sharply contoured artifacts, again not cerebral in nature.  This is a normal EEG and is similar to the previous study.

There is a 10 Hz, 50 microvolts posterior dominant alpha rhythm which is well-attenuated with eyes opened. There is a small low voltage frontal central beta activity. Hyperventilation with good effort produced small snow activity on the background but no abnormal discharges. Sleepiness is evidenced by reduced amplitude of the background as well as mildly increased snow activity but no abnormal findings.  Photic stimulation created a driving.
Heart rate was 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and night sleepiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal findings, no epileptiform discharges were seen in this tracing.  Abnormal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, there is generous beta activity noted in the background. There seems to be an artifact picked up at T5. Wicket activity is identified bilaterally and is more prominent on the left. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved. Photic stimulation is performed as the patient is starting to drift off into sleep, and there is no significant
driving response.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Excess beta.
2. A normal variant; wicket; which is more prominent on the left.
3. Some technical issues with the placement of the T3 and T5 electrodes.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: If this individual is thought to have new onset epilepsy rather than panic attacks, a follow-up study in the lab capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested. The presence of the excess beta may be seen in the context of anxiety and stress, which would certainly be present for any individual attempting to have an EEG with 3 small boys. Please contact the lab if needed to reschedule or repeat the EEG with sleep or even 24 hours of home EEG monitoring.

INTRODUCTION:  A 20 minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm with generous diffuse beta.  Supra harmonic alpha rhythm is noted on some occasions at twice the frequency of the baseline alpha rhythm.
Hyperventilation produces a small increase in amplitude.
Photic stimulation produces vigorous bilateral driving.  During photic stimulation, there is a slight amplitude asymmetry, slightly higher amplitude on the left.  There also seems to be an accentuation of faster frequency activity from the left during photic stimulation.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an unusual, but not pathological EEG.  It is considered within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The alpha harmonic, present bilaterally is a normal variant.  The prominent driving response is again a normal phenomenon as is the beta frequency activity.
The slightly more vigorous supra harmonic driving noted on the left, ipsilateral to the heterotopic tissue is not necessarily pathological and may be considered within the broad range of normal possibilities of photic response.

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient recalls 3 episodes.  The first is on the 19th at noon where she felt a little startled.  The second was at 10 p.m. where she felt a mini aura characterized by tingling sensation on her face.  She did not recall an episode at 5:25, although she did push the button for a tingling sensation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Random wakefulness and sleep includes a well-organized 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta activity.
Event time 11:22:  There is a burst of rhythmic left temporal theta delta with frequency evolution.  This is 5 seconds in duration.  There is no push button at that time.
Event time 5:25:20 p.m.:   A burst of rhythmic theta, frequency was subtle, frequency evolution lasting only 3 seconds.  Thirty seconds later the patient reports the mini-aura which she no longer recalled.
Event time 9:58 p.m.  No abnormalities on the EEG were identified at that time.
Event time10:25 a.m.:  There was another burst lasting 4 seconds in duration in the morning on the 20th which is similar to the 2 prior bursts.   No clinical features were recalled.
HR:    60 bpm
INTERVAL IMPRESSION:  There are 3 bursts of rhythmic theta from the left temporal region with frequency evolution.  These are concerning as a potential interictal epileptiform discharge.  They may also be clinically significant with the mini-auras that the patient experienced.
LONG TERM MONITORING - # 12- 72 – 06/20/2012 TO 06/21/2012
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a well defined 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  This is a sleep deprived record.  Around 10:00 p.m. the patient seems to be trying to stay up.  The EEG demonstrates small EPOCHS where the patient seems to be drowsy.   Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K-complexes, and spindles. The data is reviewed for the clinical symptoms that the patient experienced, but no epileptiform features are identified.
HR:    66 bpm
LONG TERM MONITORING - # 12-72 – 06/21/2012 TO 06/22/2012
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient reported an aura at 8 p.m. on the 21st.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Around 8 p.m., the patient is noted to transition in and out of stage 2 sleep, waking up and falling back asleep.  Fragments of deeper stages of sleep are noted overnight.
No electrographic seizures were identified.  The seizure and spike detector did not identify any other epileptiform abnormalities.
Event time 11:55:  The patient pushes the button at 11:56:12 stating that she feels as if she is about to have an aura.  She puts her hand to her chest and later appears to be tearful.  The EEG is awake at this time.  No epileptiform features were noted.   For her 8:00 p.m. the patient reported symptoms that her throat was closing with the seizure.

HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for 3 bursts of rhythmic, paroxysmal theta, all less than 4 seconds in duration, but with frequency evolution.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's clinical symptoms did not appear to be associated with well-defined epileptiform abnormalities.  On one day, however, there were discharges which appear epileptiform in nature.  While this patient did not have any of her larger spells with head turning, a feeling as if her throat was closing or impairment of awareness, this record does not exclude a diagnosis and clinically, diagnosis may be considered.

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.

No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at intermediate flash rates.

TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric POSTS, vertex
waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
bilaterally synchronous slow waves.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep 1-hour EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events

EVENTS:


6/21/2016 at 09:36

CLINICAL: the patient is lying quietly in bed with eyes closed. She opens her eyes, blinks a few
times, then turns onto her left side and stiffens her body, arching her back. There are some
superimposed irregular jerks.


EEG: there are no EEG changes, other than movement artifact. An awake background with a
sustained posterior dominant rhythm is seen intermittently. There is no postictal attenuation or
asymmetry of background rhythms.


EKG: heart rate increases from baseline 78 bpm to ictal 96 bpm



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 50 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an essentially normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG. An episode of body stiffening with back
arching has no EEG correlate and is most consistent with a nonepileptic behavioral event.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:




This is an essentially normal awake and drowsy routine EEG. An episode of body stiffening with back
arching has no EEG correlate and is most consistent with a nonepileptic behavioral event.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKGand photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.5-11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.




EVENTS:

INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped-photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated very low amplitude 11 to 11.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness the background voltage is increased and the amount of theta increases as well.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped-photic stimulation results in symmetric occipital driving with multiple flash frequencies.  Excess diffuse beta is captured.

and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:








The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During very brief periods of drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant
rhythm is seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces

technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. POSTS are noted. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.

MEDICATIONS:

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. In addition during HV there is a rhythmic theta in the
right anterior temporal region. Later in post HV this theta returns and appears to increase in
amplitude slightly and decrease in frequency. The patient can answer a simple question during it.





Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  Single right temporal discharge of unclear
significance.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG. The pattern described above is of unclear clinical
significance but the possible evolution raises the concern for a potentially epileptogenic discharge.
Repeat prolonged EEG and testing may aid in clarifying the underlying nature of the discharge.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:





INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patient's interictal findings were insignificant with normal EEG with 9
Hz posterior dominant rhythm,  without any focal findings  or epileptiform discharges.




ICTAL FINDINGS:

The patient did not have any clinical events.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. pseudoseizure



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 4 days with continuous video EEG  (3
days 95951).  This was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of symptoms.



The interictal EEG is characterized by  A normal, posterior dominant rhythm.



The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of heradmission.No other medication changes
were made during the hospitalization.



We recommend she continue to see a psychiatrist.  She and her wife are happy to do so.  With
careful review of the symptoms, the family feels that most of the symptoms have been due to
overmedication and that the patient was much improved by medication reduction.  Therefore,
neither patient nor family was eager to prolonged hospitalization or tried to elicit a nonepileptic
seizure.  The family was encouraged to speak up with practitioners to avoid overmedication.  The
patient demonstrated an understanding of the pre-existing diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures





Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.

3200 mg daily.


divalproex (DEPAKOTE) 500 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth 2 times daily.

hydrochlorothiazide (HYDRODIURIL) 25 mg tablet, Take 25 mg by mouth daily.


haloperidol (HALDOL) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth 3 times daily.

benztropine (COGENTIN) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 mg by mouth 3 times daily.

aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, Take 81 mg by mouth daily.


chlorproMAZINE (THORAZINE) 50 mg tablet, Take 50 mg by mouth 3 times daily.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.






Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  The family was
interviewed.  Some of their concerns were slurred speech which was not a paroxysmal finding but an
ongoing every day symptom.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 92 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal day 1 24 hour  routine EMU EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal video LTM routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:





INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patient's interictal findings were insignificant with normal EEG with 9
Hz posterior dominant rhythm,  without any focal findings  or epileptiform discharges.




ICTAL FINDINGS:

The patient did not have any clinical events.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. pseudoseizure



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 4 days with continuous video EEG  (3
days 95951).  This was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of symptoms.



The interictal EEG is characterized by  A normal, posterior dominant rhythm.



The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of heradmission.No other medication changes
were made during the hospitalization.



We recommend she continue to see a psychiatrist.  She and her wife are happy to do so.  With
careful review of the symptoms, the family feels that most of the symptoms have been due to
overmedication and that the patient was much improved by medication reduction.  Therefore,
neither patient nor family was eager to prolonged hospitalization or tried to elicit a nonepileptic
seizure.  The family was encouraged to speak up with practitioners to avoid overmedication.  The
patient demonstrated an understanding of the pre-existing diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures





Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:





INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patient's interictal findings were insignificant with normal EEG with 9
Hz posterior dominant rhythm,  without any focal findings  or epileptiform discharges.




ICTAL FINDINGS:

The patient did not have any clinical events.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. pseudoseizure



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 4 days with continuous video EEG  (3
days 95951).  This was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of symptoms.



The interictal EEG is characterized by  A normal, posterior dominant rhythm.



The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of heradmission.No other medication changes
were made during the hospitalization.



We recommend she continue to see a psychiatrist.  She and her wife are happy to do so.  With
careful review of the symptoms, the family feels that most of the symptoms have been due to
overmedication and that the patient was much improved by medication reduction.  Therefore,
neither patient nor family was eager to prolonged hospitalization or tried to elicit a nonepileptic
seizure.  The family was encouraged to speak up with practitioners to avoid overmedication.  The
patient demonstrated an understanding of the pre-existing diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures





Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.

EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



There are some slightly asymmetric EOMS.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep includes vertex waves and spindles. There are EOMS in sleep.


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:





INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patient's interictal findings were insignificant with normal EEG with 9
Hz posterior dominant rhythm,  without any focal findings  or epileptiform discharges.




ICTAL FINDINGS:

The patient did not have any clinical events.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. pseudoseizure



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 4 days with continuous video EEG  (3
days 95951).  This was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of symptoms.



The interictal EEG is characterized by  A normal, posterior dominant rhythm.



The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of heradmission.No other medication changes
were made during the hospitalization.



We recommend she continue to see a psychiatrist.  She and her wife are happy to do so.  With
careful review of the symptoms, the family feels that most of the symptoms have been due to
overmedication and that the patient was much improved by medication reduction.  Therefore,
neither patient nor family was eager to prolonged hospitalization or tried to elicit a nonepileptic
seizure.  The family was encouraged to speak up with practitioners to avoid overmedication.  The
patient demonstrated an understanding of the pre-existing diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures





Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.

Day  3 May 4-May 5, 2016

EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



There are some slightly asymmetric EOMS.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep includes vertex waves and spindles. There are EOMS in sleep.


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Sleep deprivation was utilized.  No events occurred.  Hyperventilation
was deferred because of the patient's pulmonary disease.



EVENTS:


NONE

HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 88 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION/ CLINICAL CORRELATION::

This is a normal  Day 3 EMU  EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.


-----------------------------------------------------------------



SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:





INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patient's interictal findings were insignificant with normal EEG with 9
Hz posterior dominant rhythm,  without any focal findings  or epileptiform discharges.




ICTAL FINDINGS:

The patient did not have any clinical events.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. pseudoseizure



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 4 days with continuous video EEG  (3
days 95951).  This was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of symptoms.



The interictal EEG is characterized by  A normal, posterior dominant rhythm.



The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of heradmission.No other medication changes
were made during the hospitalization.



We recommend she continue to see a psychiatrist.  She and her wife are happy to do so.  With
careful review of the symptoms, the family feels that most of the symptoms have been due to
overmedication and that the patient was much improved by medication reduction.  Therefore,
neither patient nor family was eager to prolonged hospitalization or tried to elicit a nonepileptic
seizure.  The family was encouraged to speak up with practitioners to avoid overmedication.  The
patient demonstrated an understanding of the pre-existing diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures





Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:





INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patient's interictal findings were insignificant with normal EEG with 9
Hz posterior dominant rhythm,  without any focal findings  or epileptiform discharges.




ICTAL FINDINGS:

The patient did not have any clinical events.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. pseudoseizure



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 4 days with continuous video EEG  (3
days 95951).  This was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of symptoms.



The interictal EEG is characterized by  A normal, posterior dominant rhythm.



The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of heradmission.No other medication changes
were made during the hospitalization.



We recommend she continue to see a psychiatrist.  She and her wife are happy to do so.  With
careful review of the symptoms, the family feels that most of the symptoms have been due to
overmedication and that the patient was much improved by medication reduction.  Therefore,
neither patient nor family was eager to prolonged hospitalization or tried to elicit a nonepileptic
seizure.  The family was encouraged to speak up with practitioners to avoid overmedication.  The
patient demonstrated an understanding of the pre-existing diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures





Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.

EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.






Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  The family was
interviewed.  Some of their concerns were slurred speech which was not a paroxysmal finding but an
ongoing every day symptom.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 92 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal day 1 24 hour  routine EMU EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal video LTM routine EEG.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:





INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patient's interictal findings were insignificant with normal EEG with 9
Hz posterior dominant rhythm,  without any focal findings  or epileptiform discharges.




ICTAL FINDINGS:

The patient did not have any clinical events.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. pseudoseizure



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 4 days with continuous video EEG  (3
days 95951).  This was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of symptoms.



The interictal EEG is characterized by  A normal, posterior dominant rhythm.



The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of heradmission.No other medication changes
were made during the hospitalization.



We recommend she continue to see a psychiatrist.  She and her wife are happy to do so.  With
careful review of the symptoms, the family feels that most of the symptoms have been due to
overmedication and that the patient was much improved by medication reduction.  Therefore,
neither patient nor family was eager to prolonged hospitalization or tried to elicit a nonepileptic
seizure.  The family was encouraged to speak up with practitioners to avoid overmedication.  The
patient demonstrated an understanding of the pre-existing diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures

Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is captured.  During drowsiness, the
background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the
alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further
to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  No typical events are captured.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a normal 15-hour continuous video EEG monitoring.  No typical events were captured.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  It is a routine 20-minute EEG with acceptable impedances, aside from the T1-T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is very drowsy throughout the EEG, but in maximal wakefulness there is 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  As he becomes drowsy, there is prominent theta within the frontal regions.  The patient was feeling asleep during photic stimulation, which still elicited harmonic and super-harmonic photic driving.  At the close of photic stimulation, patient was transitioning into stage 2 sleep.  Heart rate is 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through sleep, very drowsy patient.

TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HVand photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz , 60 uV posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: produces an increase in amplitude of the background


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.   There is also supraharmonic driving.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  A routine 21-channel EEG was performed utilizing a standard 10-20 system of electrode placement along with hyperventilation, photic stimulation, and EKG monitoring.  In the awake resting background reveals a moderate amount of 20-30 microvolt amplitude, 9-11 Hz activity posteriorly, which attenuates with eye opening.  Low voltage frontocentral beta-activity was seen, which was bilaterally symmetric.  Moderate amount of muscle eye blink and prominent EKG artifact was seen.  The patient appeared drowsy during much of the record with attenuation of posterior rhythmic activity and diminished beta activity along with increased low to medium amplitude frontocentral 4-6 Hz theta.  Positive occipital sharp transients of sleep were noted (POSTs) followed by progression to stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, central sleep spindles, and occasional K-complexes.  Hyperventilation produced no significant activation of the record.  Photic stimulation produced symmetric occipital driving.  EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm at 62 per minute.

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

FIRDA- drowsiness only



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none successful


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.  Patient behaviors were unremarkable- she prefers to


stay in bed and is inattentive.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54- 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


Impression:

Though none of the patient's typical spells were captured, this


is a normal 24 hour EEG.  FIRDA is a normal finding in the

transition to sleep.




IMPRESSION:

This three-day continuous video EEG monitoring session was


unremarkable.  The overall background is within normal limits for

an adult of this age.  Although the patient occasionally endorsed


dizziness, she never pushed the button and review of the EEG at

those times did not identify any abnormalities.  None of her


disruptive behaviors which are current home were elicited.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of


epilepsy.  Careful review of the home situation, for this elderly

woman with dementia, may help explain the screaming spells and

prevent further behaviors.

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


Continuous video EEG monitoring A 21 channel electroencephalogram

(EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG and spike detection software.

Attempts were made to keep the patient out of bed and to keep her


activated were unsuccessful.  Each day, if she was out of bed and

asked to bicycle, she got back in bed.  She typically reported


dizziness on rounds when asked directly, but she never pushed the

button for a dizzy spell.  No episodes of screaming or aggressive

or inappropriate behavior were recorded.

DAY 1 (03/01, - 3/2/2016, 06:00)



AEDs: none


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates


symmetrically with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Intermittent, mild generalized slowing is present. No focal

slowing is present.

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


Continuous video EEG monitoring A 21 channel electroencephalogram

(EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG and spike detection software.

Attempts were made to keep the patient out of bed and to keep her


activated were unsuccessful.  Each day, if she was out of bed and

asked to bicycle, she got back in bed.  She typically reported


dizziness on rounds when asked directly, but she never pushed the

button for a dizzy spell.  No episodes of screaming or aggressive

or inappropriate behavior were recorded.

DAY 1 (03/01, - 3/2/2016, 06:00)



AEDs: none


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates


symmetrically with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Intermittent, mild generalized slowing is present. No focal

slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


Continuous video EEG monitoring A 21 channel electroencephalogram

(EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG and spike detection software.

Attempts were made to keep the patient out of bed and to keep her


activated were unsuccessful.  Each day, if she was out of bed and

asked to bicycle, she got back in bed.  She typically reported


dizziness on rounds when asked directly, but she never pushed the

button for a dizzy spell.  No episodes of screaming or aggressive

or inappropriate behavior were recorded.

DAY 1 (03/01, - 3/2/2016, 06:00)



AEDs: none


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates


symmetrically with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Intermittent, mild generalized slowing is present. No focal

slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none successful



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.  She reported dizziness between noon and 1 PM.  A


normal awake pattern was noted at this time.  She did not press

the button or report the symptoms to the nurses


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.

Impression:


Though none of the patient's typical spells were captured, this

is a normal 24 hour EEG.  The dizzy spells did not have any EEG

correlate.

IMPRESSION:

This three-day continuous video EEG monitoring session was


unremarkable.  The overall background is within normal limits for

an adult of this age.  Although the patient occasionally endorsed


dizziness, she never pushed the button and review of the EEG at

IMPRESSION:

This three-day continuous video EEG monitoring session was


unremarkable.  The overall background is within normal limits for

an adult of this age.  Although the patient occasionally endorsed


dizziness, she never pushed the button and review of the EEG at

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Intermittent, mild generalized slowing is present. No focal

slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none successful



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.  Patient behaviors, such as attempted removal of EEG

electrodes were noted



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


Impression:

Though none of the patient's typical spells were captured, this

is a normal 24 hour EEG.  FIRDA is a normal finding in the

transition to sleep.

DAY 3 (03/03, - 34/2016, 010:00 AM)



AEDs: none

EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5


Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen. FIRDA was seen in the transition to


sleep.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and. Slow

wave sleep was not captured.  Likely REM was noted at 02:38 AM



Intermittent, mild generalized slowing is present. No focal

slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

FIRDA- drowsiness only



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none successful


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.  Patient behaviors were unremarkable- she prefers to


stay in bed and is inattentive.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54- 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


Impression:

Though none of the patient's typical spells were captured, this


is a normal 24 hour EEG.  FIRDA is a normal finding in the

transition to sleep.




IMPRESSION:

This three-day continuous video EEG monitoring session was


unremarkable.  The overall background is within normal limits for

an adult of this age.  Although the patient occasionally endorsed


dizziness, she never pushed the button and review of the EEG at

those times did not identify any abnormalities.  None of her


disruptive behaviors which are current home were elicited.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of


epilepsy.  Careful review of the home situation, for this elderly

woman with dementia, may help explain the screaming spells and

prevent further behaviors.

MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions: cyclobenzaprine (FLEXERIL) 5 mg tablet,  naproxen (NAPROSYN)
500 mg tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth 2 times daily (with meals).



TECHNIQUE:

A  1 hour sleep deprived Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using
the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  This is followed by prominent, rhythmic
central theta and then POSTS.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  Abundant stage II sleep was

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Hyperventilation: Produces a small amount of rhythmic background slowing

Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.  The driving response was elicited, despite the
fact that the patient was falling asleep

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The awake resting background reveals a moderate amount of 15-20 microvolt, 9-10 Hz rhythmic activity posteriorly.  A large amount of muscle artifact and generalized low voltage 20-30 Hz beta-activity was seen.  Prominent eye blink artifact was also noted.  With drowsiness, there was initial slowing followed by attenuation of posterior rhythmic activity and increasing frontocentral low to medium amplitude makes frequent theta activity.  Brief stage 2 sleep was seen with further attenuation of muscle artifact and beta and vertex waves along with very brief central sleep spindle activity.  Hyperventilation produced no significant activation of record.  Photic stimulation added no additional information.

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring continues for 22-year-old male with staring spells.  The patient had multiple push buttons for staring spells during this 24-hour section.
Background:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Abundant stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  Of note, sleep was relatively disrupted on the 1st day, but the patient seemed to be having more extensive stage 2 sleep early in the morning on the 24th.  In stage 2 sleep, occasional beta spindles were noted.  REM sleep was noted during multiple sections of the overnight recording with multiple spontaneous brief arousals from REM sleep.  There may have been some snore artifact noted at other times, but the arousals from REM sleep were not associated with epileptiform activity or significant snoring that could be detected by the recording strategy employed.
Epileptiform seizures:  None.
Pushbuttons:  On the 24th, there were 17 push button events.  Two of these were practice pushbuttons.  These events span primarily around 12:19 p.m., but standard time from 12:07 p.m. until 1:57 p.m., and then again 3:31, 4:32, and 7:18:45.  The patient is communicative and conversing with the nurse during the blinking spells.  He is awake during all of them.  After sometime, the nursing staff does not enter for every spell, but the patient can be seen clearly involved and engaged in activities and in some cases talking on the phone.  No epileptiform features were identified with the push buttons.  The EEG consistently demonstrates a normal awake pattern, although he does have some increase in heart rate.  For the 1:57 p.m. event, the patient does demonstrate a clear change in heart rate with a somewhat irregular heart rate at the end.
Epileptiform Detections:  Rare epileptiform detections were noted exclusively in sleep in this section of the record.  They are primarily seen in stage 2 sleep and include frontally predominant 2.5 to 4 Hz spike and wave activity as well as a isolated spike and wave activity.  With review using an average reference, some of the isolated spikes demonstrate a maximum between FC and F3.
Heart rate 60 to 90 to 130 BPM bpm
IMPRESSION:  This 48 hour EEG monitoring session was remarkable for:
An interictal EEG, which demonstrates spike and wave and slow spike and wave activity, at this time, exclusively in sleep, similar to the previous EEG monitoring from 2006 to 2010.
Some spike and wave activity demonstrates L FC maximum.
Multiple episodes of blinking, involuntary blinking noted and wakefulness.  No EEG change noted. Patient is awake and alert for all
On rare occasions, an irregular heart rate.

INTRODUCTION:  Routine 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This EEG captures wakefulness through sleep.  It is a technically acceptable EEG with most impedances below 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is low voltage, but there is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  The patient transitions rapidly between wakefulness and stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, spindles, and POSTS.
Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate: 60 to 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.

TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.

MEDICATIONS: Xanax, Singulair, Flonase, Prilosec, and others.
INTRODUCTION: One-hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Mu activity was identified, but testing was not performed to confirm this. There is a small amount of underlying theta in the posterior regions bilaterally. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and an increase in beta as well as attenuation of the alpha rhythm. Rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness appears in the transition in and out of sleep. Stage 2 sleep was characterized by spindles. There may be underlying snore arousals. Hyperventilation produced an increase in theta.
Photic stimulation was performed as the patient was falling asleep. There was a photic driving response noted.  In addition, rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness with a characteristic 5 Hz activity was noted during photic stimulation.
Heart rate 60 to 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and a brief stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness is a normal variant.  No definitive epileptiform features were noted.  The patient appears to be quite drowsy with frequent arousals and snoring. Clinical evaluation may be of value.

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Semana 1: 1000 mg AM, 1500 mg PM, Semana 2 +:
1500 mg 2x/dia



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  1 hour Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.






EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen. Generous beta was noted.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, but not sustained. Slow wave sleep was not
captured.


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Deeper stages of sleep were recorded.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 66

MEDICATIONS: none listed




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a




mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates


symmetrically with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured.


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 108 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal Awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no


clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.

A normal record does not rule out a convulsive disorder. If

clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  A 24-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab

using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel

EKG.  Hyperventilation was not completed.  Photic stimulation was


completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.



DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is


well organized with symmetric reactive 9 Hz posterior dominant

rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by paroxysmal rhythmic

background slowing.  Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.




Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.




Heart rate 78 bpm.



IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.

26 y.o. female with a history of seizues since childhood.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


topiramate (TOPAMAX) 50 mg tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth 2 times daily. 50 mg qHS x1wk, 100
mg qHS x1 wk, 50 mg qam and 100 mg qpm x1 wk, 100 mg BID



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with fair cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


A single ~ 3 minute event is captured.  It occurs out of drowsiness.  Clinically, there is no movement
at the onset of the event.  When the technologist asks the patient to relax her jaw, she appears to be
confused and not responding to commands/ questions very quickly.  Electrographically, patient
demonstrates a normal awake background throughout the episode.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:





This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy 1 hour  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

A single ~3 minute event that is associated with some confusion and slow reactivity has no abnormal
ictal correlate.  Of note, this event does no represent patient's typical event semiology.

SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.5-11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed (due to a reported heart valvular defect)



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.






Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep 1-hour EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep 1-hour EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.


This is the second normal EEG for this patient.

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-9.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal 
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric 
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Patient very rapidly transitions from wakefulness to stage 
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) 
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
	No epileptiform discharges
	Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 23-minute EEG, awake, and mostly asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges 
on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Rapid transions from 
wakefulness to stage II sleep are suggestive of an excessively drowsy patient versus an underlying 
sleep disorder - please correlate clinically.
