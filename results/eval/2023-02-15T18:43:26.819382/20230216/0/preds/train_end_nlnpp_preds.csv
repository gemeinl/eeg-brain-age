INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake record in a patient who becomes cooperative over the course of the study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage, well organized with a symmetric, reactive posterior rhythm of approximately 10 Hz.  There is generous background beta activity.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the posterior dominant rhythm with an increase in beta activity.
HR:  116 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The beta activity described above may be due to this patient’s medications.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing in the lab with sleep and hyperventilation could be useful.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow and poorly organized with a low voltage delta and theta frequency activity. This pattern is seen when the patient is awake or stuporous.  The patient is observed by a nurse and tech and there is IV or other drip.  There was an unusual, somewhat periodic complex identified in the background with an unusual field of spread and phase reversal.  In specific montages including a referential ear montage, the activity is clearly maximum on the right but with spread to the left and in some montages which accentuate P4, it is possible to identify a P4 phase reversal.  The activity is usually unilateral but sometimes bilateral and sometimes seems to be asynchronous on the other side.  Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity, as well as brief arousals.
The unusual, periodic activity in this record can be clearly differentiated from EKG artifact and there is no identifiable other source of artifact for this individual.
HR:  104 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Periodic activity poorly localized but probably maximum in the right parietal region, although sometimes generalized.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing differs from previous studies and suggests a process in the parietal regions, which may be epileptiform in nature.  No seizures were recorded.

There does not appear to be an underlying epileptiform correlate with the movements, however.  As the EEG continues, approximately six minutes into the EEG, the movements decrease and the EEG pattern is one of diffuse background slowing with poor organization and a mixture of rhythmic delta and theta frequency activity.  There are occasional shifting asymmetries and occasionally there is higher amplitude frontally predominant delta in one hemisphere or the other.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is medium to low amplitude and is comprised of a pattern that is a mixture of rhythmic 4 to 6 Hz theta frequency activity, which occurs in bursts with slower underlying low voltage delta activity in a somewhat discontinuous or paroxysmal pattern. The theta activity is most prominent in the frontal regions where it is sometimes higher amplitude and more sharply contoured and may reach a frequency of 7 to 8 Hz, with a 7 to 8 Hz discharge among the theta frequency activity.  Stimulation of the patient does not significantly activate the record.
HR:  142 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a pattern of rhythmic theta, smaller amounts of delta, and subtle discontinuity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are non-specific, but support a diffuse disorder of cerebral function.  The pattern would be typical of that of pharmacologic coma. No definite focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record. If additional information is required, a repeat tracing after this patient’s sedative, hypnotic medications have worn off may be of use.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage and rich in beta frequency activity.  There is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm identified from the right occipital region.  The primary pattern is a drowsy pattern, but in drowsiness there is sharply contoured theta frequency activity maximum at F7.  In addition, there seems to be a slight variability and at times there is a bit more theta frequency in the right frontal region compared to the left, although the central regions are symmetric.  As the patient continues in a relatively drowsy state, there is persistent rhythmic theta identified from the left frontotemporal region with left frontal sharp and slow wave complexes.  These are discrete and are best identified with a sensitivity of 5.  They can be identified both in the montages which accentuate temporal abnormalities, as well as referential montages. Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.   Brief drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background theta.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and does not activate the record. Photic stimulation elicits driving at 7 and 15 Hz as well as faster flash frequencies.
HR:  102 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration, a repeat tracing would be useful.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the ER using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is drowsy.  The background EEG is primarily theta.  There is some temporal wicket activity.  There are intermittent bursts of sharply contoured irregular, higher amplitude theta frequency activity with bursts typically lasting under three seconds in duration.  Most of them last under one second.  Some of these have an underlying spike and slow wave complex seen in association with them.  In addition, unfortunately this is also the region where the patient has EKG artifact and an irregular heart rate.  The bursts of irregular temporal theta have a left mid-to-anterior temporal underlying spike and slow wave or sharp and slow wave complex.  On occasion, that epileptiform activity isn’t seen in the posterior rather than the anterior temporal region.  In addition, there is a bilateral distribution of the regular theta.
Stimulation of the patient elicits an alerting with a very brief posterior dominant rhythm, which is approximately 7 to 8 Hz.
HR:  96 BPM, irregular.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Irregular, sharply contoured bursts of theta activity with an underlying sharp wave from the left temporal region with variable maximum and occasional bitemporal involvement.
Generalized background slowing.
Irregular heart rate.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The irregular heart rate or the epileptiform activity could account for this patient’s loss of consciousness and clinical correlation may be useful.

MEDICATIONS: Ativan, morphine, Haldol, Fentanyl and many others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is sedated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial portions of the record are low voltage beta with superimposed significant muscle activity.  As the recording continues, the patient becomes less tense and a low voltage beta pattern is identified with symmetric underlying low voltage delta.  Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting with an increase in muscle, as well as the brief appearance of some alpha frequency activity.  There is variability in the record and there are portions of the record where there is lower voltage symmetric theta and delta.  The tech notes that the patient occasionally tenses his hands or bites on his endotracheal tube, again producing an increase in muscle and beta activity.  In later portions of the record, as the patient appears to relax, there is lower voltage, slow delta seen.
HR:  102 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with beta frequency pattern.
Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Some of the features described above are compatible with a pharmacologic coma.  The spontaneous reactivity and variability are positive prognostic signs even in the setting of sedation.  With relaxation, we see a diffuse pattern of delta supporting a diffuse disorder of cerebral function and contributing factors may include the CNS processes described above or the medications.  No focal features and no epileptiform features were seen.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is disorganized and the normal posterior alpha rhythm is not seen.  There is diffuse beta fast activity.  There is nearly continuous right temporal focal slowing as well as an occasional breach rhythm identified.  Post-hyperventilation shows frequent right temporal and occasional right central sharp activity as well as a breach rhythm.

MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The child is described as crying.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This is an extremely challenging EEG due to muscle and motion artifact, however, in the interpretable portions of the record, the background is diffusely slow with a mixture of beta and theta frequency activity.  The anticipated developmental milestones for a child of this age are not well defined.  There are brief portions of the record when the child awakens with spontaneous eye opening and eye closure.  At this time, there is a suggestion of a 6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm in a background with rhythmic 3 to 4 Hz activity.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is hypersynchronous, high amplitude, frontally predominant delta activity, as well as some rhythmic slowing from the left.  In the brief portions of the record without movement artifact, there appears to be an underlying sharp and slow wave or spike and slow wave focus from the posterior regions.
HR:  140 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a child of this age due to:
Absence of some of the developmental milestones, as well as appropriate developmental organization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Because of the amount of artifact, no other inferences should be made from this EEG.  There appears to be underlying epileptiform activity from the right as well as asynchronicity as the child drifts off to sleep.  If further characterization of this child’s epilepsy is important, a repeat, sedated study may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and sedated with Versed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is asymmetric and low voltage.  The normal posterior alpha rhythm is barely seen.  There is diffuse beta activity.  There is a nearly continuous left frontal and central slowing with polymorphic and arrhythmic delta activity.  Fast activity on the left anterior was also observed.  Stimulation of the patient did not cause variability.

HR:  114 BPM.

1. Asymmetric, disorganized and low voltage background.
2. Diffuse beta activity.
3. Focal slowing of polymorphic and arrhythmic delta activity in the left frontal and central areas.
4. Fast activity in the left anterior region.
5. Lack of variability with stimulation.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing demonstrates a severe cerebral dysfunction involving both gray and white matter.  The polymorphic slowing in the left frontal central region is suggestive of an underlying pathological process in this patient.  The diffuse beta activity together with fast activity in the left anterior region, as well as the absence of variability with stimulation, may be secondary to medications such as a pharmacological coma or patient in coma secondary to a structural lesion in the brain involving the reticular formation.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  When the patient is more stabilized or weaned off sedative medications, a follow-up EEG may be helpful.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is symmetric, continuous, and very low voltage with excessive beta activity.  A few 5 to 6 Hz delta activity is seen in the posterior region.

Excessive beta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing is suggestive of a cerebral dysfunction involving both gray and white matter.  The excessive amount of beta activity may be due to medications such as benzodiazepine use.  The low voltage pattern may be due to the patient’s age and is considered normal for a patient of this advanced age.  In comparison to this patient’s previous EEG of February 19, 2004, as well as the presence of interaction caused by stimulation, this EEG is much improved.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is nearly obscured by muscle, but underlying the muscle the activity appears to be of low voltage and relatively continuous.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, there is less in the way of background muscle and the EEG is a mixture of alpha and theta frequency activity.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an intrahemispheric asymmetry apparent.  There is a posterior dominant rhythm identified of approximately 7 Hz on the left, but the faster frequency activity from the right hemisphere appears to be relatively attenuated.  As the patient becomes more responsive, again the oral facial dyskinesias and the prominent muscle activity obscure the EEG.

The most notable abnormality in this record is identified in wakefulness, augmented slightly in hyperventilation and includes rhythmic theta frequency activity from the right mid-temporal region.  In hyperventilation, some of this focal slowing becomes less rhythmic and slows to arrhythmic, 1.5 to 2 Hz. Brief  drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background beta activity.  Although the background is somewhat sharply contoured, there is no definite epileptiform activity in the region of the focal slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for a child of this age with a 10 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Noted in wakefulness and increasing in drowsiness is a right central spike and slow wave complex with a large field of spread.  This ranges from discrete to a high amplitude complex and at times the field of spread varies from central parietal to frontocentral.  It may occur as couplets or a brief run of epileptiform activity and does appear to be associated with underlying focal slowing in the central parietal region.  Photic stimulation elicits a scant driving response bilaterally.  The epileptiform activity can be seen on one occasion during photic stimulation, but is not augmented by photic. Hyperventilation elicits a small amount of theta in the background.  Following this, drowsiness is characterized by a small amount of generalized background slowing.
HR:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Right central spike and slow wave activity with occasional brief bursts of spike and slow wave activity.
Subtle underlying focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.  Because of the concomitant focal slowing, consideration for an underlying structural or functional abnormality rather than a benign localization-related epilepsy is appropriate, although this may still represent a somewhat unusual benign localization-related epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION: Digital EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the child is asleep with abundant stage II sleep with a high amplitude pattern with vertex waves and spindles.  The child is awakened for photic stimulation and at that time is relatively drowsy.  A photoelectric response is seen and there is a driving response seen at intermediate and faster flash frequencies.  Although the patient remains drowsy, hyperventilation is successfully performed, producing some rhythmic posteriorly predominant slowing.  At the close of the record, a well-defined awake state is achieved with a 9.5 Hz, 75 uV posterior dominant rhythm.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and includes a subtle, discontinuous pattern.  When there is activity identified, the activity is mixed frequency, low voltage, with alpha and theta frequency activity as well as smaller amounts of delta.  The periods with activity range from 3 to 7 seconds in duration and the periods of suppression averages approximately 5 seconds in duration.  There is some variability towards the close of the record.  The periods with activity are a little bit longer lasting than those in the initial portions of the record and there is some higher amplitude theta there.  Stimulation of the patient does not clearly activate the record, although stimulation was performed primarily at the close of the record as the discontinuity is improving.  There are a few shifting asymmetries more prominent at the end of the record.  There is also a breach rhythm a bit more prominent towards the close of the record.  A single F3 sharp wave is identified.
HR:  92 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Initial burst suppression pattern, which gradually improves as the recording continues.
Some shifting asymmetries with a breach rhythm.  Some portions of the record demonstrate a breach rhythm on the right with a bit more slower frequency activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function.  The improvement over the course of a brief EEG may be due to either improvement in this patient’s neurologic status, or the duration of time since his Phenobarbital infusion.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is a relatively immediate postictal study.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage, relatively featureless with slow, low voltage delta, smaller amounts of theta frequency activity, muscle, and a fair amount of beta. Stimulation of the patient produces a small amount of theta frequency activity.  Towards the close of the record, there is a small increase in background theta.  At the very close of the record, rare, high amplitude right frontal sharp waves are seen.  At the close of the record, occasional high amplitude right frontal sharp waves, as well as bursts of sharply contoured delta are identified.

HR:  __ BPM. CHECK PRELIM SHEET

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with severe generalized slowing.
2. High amplitude right frontal sharp waves and associated focal slowing, which crescendo at the end of the EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a severe, diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter.  The beta may be due to medications.  The presence of the right frontal sharp waves really just at the close of the record with at times an almost periodic nature suggests an acute, postictal pattern and an additional EEG recording may be useful in order to make sure that additional seizures do not recur.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. No previous EEGs were available for comparison.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a 9.5 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm in a record rich in low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  When not stimulated, the patient drifts off to sleep with slow rolling eye movements, attenuation of the alpha rhythm, and an increase in background beta.  There had been crying earlier and the patient seems to have calmed down as she drifts off to sleep.  Brief stage I sleep is characterized by vertex waves.  At 15:37, the tech notes that the patient is not responding.
PHOTIC STIMULATION: The tech attempts to awaken the patient for additional testing.  The EEG shows a slightly awake or drowsy pattern, but the tech notes that the patient is not responding to verbal stimuli.  Photic stimulation continues.  The patient is awake at this time, and a driving response is identified.  In between the driving intervals, a well-defined alpha rhythm can be seen.
HR:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage I sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  It is not clear why the patient was not responding to the technologist’s commands.  She remained motionless and consideration for either excessive drowsiness or an emotional reaction may be appropriate. The background beta may be due to this patient’s medicines.

DESCRIPTION


OF  THE   RECORD:  The   background  EEG  is  disorganized   with


generalized background slowing, excessive theta and delta activity, as well as superimposed  beta frequency activity.   Generous muscle movement  artifact obscures the observation  of the record. There is some reactivity  in response to voice, which decreases the delta activity.  The amplitude ranges from 50 to 70 uV.   Normal  alpha activity  cannot be identified. No seizure  activity was seen.

HR: 114BPM.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Slow and poorly organized background.
2.   Absent alpha activity
3.   Reactivity to stimuli

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were  identified  in this record.    This tracing supports  a diffuse  disturbance  of cerebra l function with involvement  of  both  gray and white matter.   This can be seen in patients  with toxic metabolic disturbances  or medicine effect. If epilepsy is clinical concern a repeat EEG may be helpful.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is somnolent throughout much of the record.  At this time, the EEG is markedly slow with a mixture of delta and smaller amounts of theta.  This poorly formed, periodic complex is seen in the record with a somewhat unusual field of spread picked up in the left frontal and right posterior quadrant.  Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting response with an increase in theta.  In addition, there is also spontaneous arousals with an increase in theta.  Because of the movement artifact, it is difficult to determine if this periodic delta disappears.  It appears to attenuate to some extent with stimulation.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. She has a frontal craniotomy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern with generous theta activity.  There is a breach rhythm identified in the frontal regions.  This is more prominent in the left frontal region than the right.  In addition, there is some arrhythmic delta activity, again more prominent from the left than the right.   Stimulation of the patient is performed at the end of the record and on only one occasion, but clearly produces an increase in background alpha and theta frequency activity.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a low voltage, 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is the appearance of theta activity particularly in the frontocentral regions, prominent both in early drowsiness and in hyperventilation.  Vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS are identified in stage II sleep. In stage II sleep, there are a handful of vertex waves, which may phase reverse just slightly to the left or right of the midline.
Photic stimulation elicits a bilateral driving response.
HR:  120 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1.	What appears to be slightly asymmetric vertex waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is a small amount of theta identified in this record early in drowsiness and in hyperventilation as can be seen in the context of HIV infection.  These slightly asymmetric vertex waves are of unclear clinical significance and may be correlated with imaging and history.

INTRODUCTION: Portable digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The patient is intubated and unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is disorganized with superimposed excessively slow activity of theta and delta.  There is also a great deal of muscle movement artifact.  After the filter and sensitivity is adjusted, the excessive delta activity is also seen diffusely on the background.  The normal posterior dominant alpha rhythm is not identified.  After adjusting the sensitivity, the background appears to be somewhat asymmetric with attenuation on the right hemisphere.  Stimulation of the patient temporarily increases the slow waves, as well as increasing the amplitude on the background.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Disorganized background.
Background slowing with mild asymmetry with attenuation in the right hemisphere.
Absent alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This abnormal EEG pattern is indicative of a cerebral dysfunction involving both gray and white matter, as well as the central nuclei in the midline.  The asymmetric EEG pattern may be suggestive of a structural abnormality.  Correlation with neuroimaging studies may be helpful.  However, the pattern is non-specific as to the etiology and can be seen in patients with encephalopathy secondary to metabolic, infectious, structural lesions, or postictal phase.  Clinical correlation is recommended.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record. This is the third EEG for this individual.  The two previous EEGs indicated that he had febrile convulsions.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for a child of this age with an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  In sleep, vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles are identified.
The major abnormality in this record, is discrete bursts of frontally predominant 3 Hz spike and wave activity seen in the transition to and from stage II sleep.  These are high amplitude discharges, typically occurring in discrete pairs, frontally predominant, symmetric, ranging from 3 to 3.5 Hz.  They can overlap with a spindle, which is a normal morphology of stage II sleep.  On one occasion, a pair of spike and wave complexes may be associated with an arousal.  At the close of the record, the child is stimulated from sleep, and occipitally predominant rhythmic slowing is followed by an awake pattern with LAMBDA when the child is more fully awake.
HR:  120 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	The appearance of frontally predominant, high amplitude spike and wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This activity was not seen in the two previous EEGs.  Correlation with this patient’s history may be helpful in that there were two previous EEGs demonstrating febrile convulsions with a child who may have developed afebrile convulsions and an EEG pattern that is most consistent with an inherited epilepsy.

They may be in the left occipital or T5 left posterior temporal.  They have a generous field of spread in the bi-occipital regions and some of them have a different field in the left posterior temporal region, but involving the centroparietal areas as well.  The sharp waves can be seen in association with the bursts of FIRDA or triphasic waves, or independently.  Photic stimulation does seem to elicit a driving response at faster flash frequencies.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF  THE  RECORD: In wakefulness, there  is  a  10  Hz,  50  uV poste1ior dominant rhythm.  The patient has shaking of his head from side to side.   This is noted in the waking background.   Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record.   The patient has increased shaking of his head from side to side during hyperventilation, but remains responsive with the technologist.   The shaking produces muscle artifact.   The patient appears to be very nervous.  No pathological abnormalities were seen in hyperventilation.   Hyperventilation was followed by brief drowsiness, but deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
During photic stimulation, the patient had tremulousness of his hands, shaking of his head back and forth, and unusual vocalizations. These behaviors were associated with muscle a1iifact in the EEG, but no epileptiform activity.    The patient also had shaking from side to side and up and down with asynchronous movements.  The behaviors lasted for four minutes.  After the patient stopped moving around, LAMBDA waves were seen followed by an alpha rhythm.   As this prolonged behavior resolved, the patient has shaking of his right hand and ""feels like hell.""
HR:  70 BPM increasing to 120 BPM with the spells. IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This patient's behaviors were not associated with epileptiform activity. In addition, they were prolonged, waxing and waning.   The patient appeared to be anxious with these behaviors. Consideration for a non-epileptic process is appropriate.

INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG is performed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electro-placement  with 1 channel of EKG. The EEG demonstrates jerking of the patient including mouth and shoulders.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	Background EEG is markedly abnormal. There is cerebral activity identified bilaterally. There is sharply contoured paroxysmal approximately 3 Hz activity in the occipital regions, some of which seems to have an underlying sharper spike or fast component with it. This does not entirely correlate with the twitching, and the twitching is typically a very rapid myoclonic jerk with a different frequency. The occipitally predominant pattern is not clearly associated with a sustained motor phenomenon. In some sections of the record, the activity is clear. The epileptiform activity in the occipital regions is clearly maximum on the right. Some of the myoclonic jerking almost produces a clear EEG correlate that can be seen
by the camera, although it is seen by the tech, and at other
times the jerking can be witnessed, but overall the camera seems to underestimate the activity. Towards the close of the record, the myoclonic jerking seems to have abated, but the occipitally predominant slowing with this underlying fast discharge
persists.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, background EEG is well organized with low voltage, 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of voltage, frontocentral beta activity. There is a very subtle low voltage theta observed from the left temporal region which is rhythmic in nature and present prior to hyperventilation. Hyperventilation does not otherwise activate the record. As the patient becomes drowsy intermittent rhythmic theta is identified in the left temporal region and transitions from anterotemporal to posterotemporal.

INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated and responds to tactile stimuli by moving about.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The most prominent features are a posteriorly predominant periodic complex which appears maximum in the right rather than the left.  The periodic sharp activity in this record has variable fields and variable maximum, including 02, T6 and even F8 phase reversal. Other maxima for these periodic complexes include the left frontal region.  Stimulation
of the patient produces an arousal, as described above.  There are independent,
periodic sharp waves observed from either hemisphere, some of which are asynchronous and some of which are seen exclusively unilateral on the left or the right, although the right occipital seems to be the most prominent discharge in this record. The background includes smaller amounts of irregular theta and delta as well as intermittently discontinuous pattern.  Periods of suppression which are one second in duration typically occur after an occipital high amplitude periodic sharp wave.  Agitation including movement of the patient's head is not associated with ictal change.  On one occasion there is a brief build up of the right occipital sharp waves.
HR: 	72  bpm
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Periodic complexes from multiple locations in both hemispheres.
2. 	A brief buildup of right occipital sharp waves.
3. 	Markedly abnormal background.
4. 	Intermittently  discontinuous pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a very irritative process.   In addition, the discontinuity  and the markedly abnormal background  are worrisome features following cardiac arrest.  Additional evaluation for some clinical seizures as well as evaluation of the severity of this patient's anoxic encephalopathy is warranted.

In addition, shifting arrhythmic delta activity, some of which is sharply contoured on the left with a subtle underlying sharp wave is observed. As the patient becomes drowsier, shifting arrhythmic delta can be seen from either temporal region. Some of this focal slowing on the right is posterior temporal.

IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Shifting arrhythmic delta from the right or left hemisphere.
2. 	Some sharply contoured slowing from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   The focal slowing described above is nonspecific in an adult of this age. Correlation with imaging and a history of cerebrovascular disease may be helpful as this kind of slowing is commonly seen in that age group. There is some sharply contoured slowly and some subtle sharp waves on the left in this individual with a past history of epilepsy.

sometimes a little agitated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There are brief portions in the record where the
patient is calm, but awake. The background EEG at this time includes some alpha
frequency activity with a hint of a 1 0 Hertz alpha rhythm on the left. It is also seen on
occasion on the right. There is some superimposed focal slowing observed in the right
hemisphere in relaxed wakefulness. Features of drowsiness include attenuation of
alpha and theta frequency activity as well as some delta. There is also some occasional
head rocking, but a suggestion of some right frontal delta.

if seizures are an· important consideration, reevaluation of the left temporal sharp wave
is recommended. Focal slowing on the right with disruption of fast or frequency activities
is congruent with a history of a MCA cortical infarct.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the alpha rhythm is present
bilaterally but a bit disrupted on the right. It reaches 8.3 Hz maximum. There is a clear
intra-hemispheric asymmetry as well as a craniotomy defect and a breach rhythm.
Faster frequency activity in wakefulness is initially disrupted on the right. In addition,
there is arrhythmic delta activity in the right hemisphere with an underlying right mid to
posterior temporal region, phase reversal at T4 but at times nearly isoelectric at T4/T6. As the patient transitions in and out sleep, this sharp wave on 1 occasion appears
maximum at T 4. In addition, as the patient transitions into sleep, the breach rhythm
becomes more prominent. As beta frequency activity increases in drowsiness, the beta
is accentuated in the right frontal region. Photic stimulation does elicit a driving
response although the patient is drifting off to sleep in photic. The photic driving
response is more vigorous on the left in comparison than the right. It is also confounded
by the fact that intermittently she started to fall off to sleep and POSTS are observed.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is incubated.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is asleep throughout much of the record, but a wake pattern is observed.  The background  EEG is remarkable for an interhemispheric asymmetry.  The activity is lower voltage on the right compared to the left. The left is higher amplitude.  In stage 2 sleep there are spindle activity on the left, but not on the right.   In
addition, there is some bursts of sharply contoured delta and a handful of sharp waves in the left
central or central temporal region. Stimulation of the patient produces an alerting response with an ability for the patient to follow commands.  At that time the activity on the left is essentially rhythmic theta, but remains lower voltage and suppressed  on the right.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Interhemispheric asymmetry  with lower voltage, more suppressed activity on the right.
2. 	Left temporal sharply contoured slowing.
3. 	Left temporal sharp waves.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated but arousable.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates initially a very low voltage, suppressed pattern. When the patient is resting comfortably, the EEG includes a low voltage, suppressed pattern with intermittent discontinuity and intermittent asymmetries including times of pattern that is discontinuous on one side versus the other. In addition, when cerebral activity is seen with the patient resting quietly, it is of theta frequency activity. Stimulation of the patient produces oral movements and eye movements. At that point, the EEG demonstrates relatively low-voltage, featureless pattern.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital  video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement. 	.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  At the start of the study, a lot of initial movement muscle artifact is seen. For a short period of time, however, it clears and a slow background is seen with extensively delta with theta seen. There is also interhemispheric asymmetry with slower rhythm seen in the right hemisphere. As the record continues, again on the video, movement of the patient is seen and the background is obscured by muscle artifact.

HR:     90 bpm and irregular.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Slowing of the background consistently with delta and some theta activity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There is no epileptiform activity seen on this record, but much of the EEG is obscured with muscle artifact from the patient's moving. The slow background is nonspecific, but is consistent with an encephalopathy.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a dramatic
intrahemispheric asymmetry. While the right hemisphere is moderately slow with a theta frequency pattern and some delta, the left hemisphere demonstrates essentially continuous mixed arrhythmic theta and delta, primarily delta, with sharp waves identified in the left hemisphere with variable maximum including C3, T3 and F7. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing and an increase in beta with beta spindles on the right. The sharp waves on the left range from broadly contoured wave forms to higher amplitude spike and slow wave complexes. The patient arouses spontaneously.

HR: 112 bpm and irregular

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Prominent intrahemispheric asymmetry with arrhythmic delta activity on the right and disruption of faster frequency activity.
2. Sharp waves identified in the left hemisphere with variable maximum including left central and temporal region.

CLINICAL INTERPRETATION: This EEG supports a structural or functional process on the left which is epileptogenic in nature. No seizures were recorded.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1   channel EKG. Patient is intubated.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the record begins, a slow bilateral background of theta and delta activity is seen.  There is an interhemispheric asymmetry with some faster activity seen  in the right hemisphere. The background is suppressed.  In the left hemisphere arrhythmic sharp delta waves are seen with a huge field of spread. At times they stop and they start as the record continues, and at times they seem to go away. There is no evolution, but by the end of the record there is a question whether there would be more evolution in this left hemispheric sharp wave pattern as the record continued.

HR:	72 bpm


IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Left hemisphere sharp waves.
2.	Slow background with slower frequencies in the left hemisphere.
3. 	Suppression of the background.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:   The slowing of the background is nonspecific but could be a result of severe cerebral dysfunction and the focal slowing could be a result of the structural abnormality from her history of a subdural hematoma. The continued left hemispheric sharp waves is consistent with an irrigative focus for epilepsy. At the end of the record there is a question whether there would be continuation and evolution of these sharp waves, which we do not see in this record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is abnormal. The overall background is slow with posterior dominate rhythm below 8.5 Hz. The technologist notes that the patient's scalp is dirty and that she seems extraordinarily sleepy. In relaxed
wakefulness there are paroxysmal bursts of high amplitude rhythmic frontally predominate 3.5 to
4 Hz activity some of which is notched.  The patient is awake, during hyperventilation and the video is used to confirm the patient is in fact awake, but vertex sharp waves are noted with paroxysmal bursts of rhythmic theta in hyperventilation. Other features of hyperventilation include the intermittent paroxysmal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. The findings
described above are nonspecific but do support a diffuse disturbance of cerebral
function. The response to tactile stimulation appeared to be an attenuation which is a
pathological response. The considerations for this record include exposure to sedative
hypnotic medications. In this individual who is 48 hours post arrest, clinical evaluation
and, if appropriate, evoked potential testing may be helpful for prognosis.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were recorded.  This is an awake and sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized for an adult of this age with an alpha of approximately 8 Hz and some background 4 and 6 Hz activity.  There is a fair amount of movement artifact noted.
Hyperventilation is performed early in the record with good effort.  It clearly produces some background slowing, as well as some movement artifact and cannot be considered focal.  Following hyperventilation, as the patient drifts off to sleep, there is some shifting focal slowing with isolated theta or delta.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

HR:    96 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG age due to:
1. Background disorganization.
2. Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
3. Excess theta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These are all mild to modest findings.  There were no epileptiform features.  Multiple medications may have contributed to the pattern
described above and a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  A repeat study capturing more prolonged sleep may be helpful to identify epileptiform activity.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 6 Hz, which does not appear to be reactive to eye opening.  There is not a normal amount of frontal central beta.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
During the recording the patient is stimulated, but there appears to be no clear change in the record.  At times intermittently there is periods of faster frequencies coming through the background, but this does not appear to be due to stimulation and it just occurs for seconds.  It may represent arousal.  Overall the background is also consistent with some abnormal discharges, which I will discuss in the next paragraph.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 mV.  In addition, there is intermittent triphasic waves seen throughout the recording.
There is also some sharply contoured transient that are maximal in the midline prefrontal, as well as vertex region.  However, this has more of a metabolic/triphasic morphology and does not appear to be epileptic.

MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm which is identified bilaterally.  There is a prominent breach rhythm identified with accentuation of amplitude of activity in the left central region as well as underlying arrhythmic delta activity in that same region.  Despite some head rocking artifact and the breach, as the patient becomes drowsy a left central sharp wave emerges from that region, again with accentuation of the breach.  Drowsiness is also characterized by an increase in beta followed by vertex waves.  The patient transitions in and out of sleep.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in both generalized slowing as well as accentuating the focal slowing from the left and to some extent the sharp wave in the left central region.
Photic stimulation was performed as the patient is transitioning in and out of sleep.  A driving response was identified.

Last grand mal seizure several months ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was an awake and asleep record.
Technical: There was no mention that this patient had an asymmetric cranium or asymmetric eye movements. There were a number of artifacts noted and there was an unacceptable impedance at SP2. There was also a fair amount of muscle artifact noted in the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized.  There is an alpha rhythm of 7-8 Hz.
The record can be re-reviewed to eliminate the FP2 artifact but there still appears to be some focal slowing in the right frontal region.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is again an appearance of some arrhythmic delta activity in the right hemisphere, a bit more prominent in the right frontal area.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude in the background.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow and disorganized record.
Question right frontal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Given the technical features described above, the focal findings described above are of unclear clinical significance.  A repeat tracing with careful attention to the impedance is appropriate.  In addition, it is possible that this patient has a craniotomy defect which may have contributed to the pattern described above but finding was not recorded in the technical section.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is an 84-year-old woman who is unresponsive after an episode of asystole of unknown duration.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, heparin, famotidine.
INTRODUCTION:
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency up to gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude, beta and delta, 1-2 second periods of background discontinuity and diffuse abundant low to moderate amplitude EMG artifact.  EMG artifact is highest in amplitude over the right frontal and frontocentral electrodes.  According to the EEG technologist, no noticeable twitching/movement was identified.  Video review does not reveal a source of this EMG artifact.  Any epileptiform discharges would be masked by this EMG artifact.  There were no clear electrographic seizures.  A single EKG lead demonstrated a heart rate of fewer than 60 beats a minute up to 2 seconds, this is between some of the QRS complexes.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Periods of discontinuity.
Abundant EMG artifact that would obscure any underlying epileptiform activity.
No clear electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 22 minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and periods of discontinuity.  These findings indicate etiologically no specific cerebral dysfunction in this patient, at least partially related to the period of anoxia.
To better assess presence of any epileptiform discharges or ictal activity, a repeat study with administration of a paralytic agent would be of benefit.  These findings were conveyed to the neurology primary team.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 32-year-old woman who has cognitive dysfunction and seizures.  The last seizure was approximately 1 month ago.  The seizures are characterized by eye fluttering, __________ and shallow rapid breaths.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Keppra, Zanaflex and loratadine.
CONDITIONING OF RECORDING:  The recording is performed according tot he standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.   Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This was a technically difficult study since the patient was not cooperative.  Therefore, high impedances were present at the beginning of the recording on several electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is continuous movement throughout the recording that limits interpretation of the recording.  During several periods of relative calmness the posterior dominant rhythm consists of low to moderate amplitude, polymorphic 10-11 Hz alpha activity.  The anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient is preserved.  No normal sleep architecture is present.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Step photic stimulation appears to resolve in symmetrical occipital driving at high rate/frequencies.  No obvious electrographic seizures were captured.
FINDINGS:
Technically a limited study due to nearly continuous movement.
No stage II sleep.
No electrographic seizures.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 34-year-old woman with a history of seizure disorder who now presents with increasing seizure frequency.  Her last seizure occurred approximately two weeks ago.  Her medications include Dilantin, sertraline, venlafaxine and diphenhydramine.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10-1/2 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness, the amount of diffuse theta and frontal central beta increases.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces mild diffuse background slowing as well as brief bursts of moderate to high amplitude diffuse frontally predominant somewhat rhythmic theta activity.  Similar activity is observed post hyperventilation as well as during drowsiness.  Photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  Bursts of diffuse frontally predominant moderate to high amplitude somewhat rhythmic theta activity are also observed during photic stimulation.
A single EKG lead demonstrates a heart rate that is at times fewer than 60 beats per minute.
FINDINGS:
No stage II sleep.
No clear epileptiform discharges.
Brief bursts of moderate to high amplitude diffuse frontally predominant theta activity that occur during hyperventilation, post hyperventilation, during drowsiness and during photic stimulation.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was comatose, unresponsive and was examined during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The overall pattern is one of diffuse delta with slow delta and bursts of frontally predominant delta.  In addition, there is prominent beta noted in the background.  The patient was examined on 2 occasions.  On 1 occasion, there was a subtle increase in rhythmic delta which is a little bit faster, trending more towards 3 Hz was noted when the patient was  unstimulated.  Tactile stimulation at the very end of the EEG also produced a little bit of reactivity.
Heart rate 102 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing.
Absence of the normal wave forms.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Although reactivity to external stimuli was subtle it was present and this is a positive prognostic factor.  Of note, this patient's sedative hypnotic medications can play a role in the pattern described above.

Patient has not returned to baseline mental status, not speaking well, confused, evaluated for subclinical status epilepticus.

MEDICATIONS:  Versed, others, phenytoin.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the neuro ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  This is a technically very challenging EEG in an uncooperative patient.  The EEG captures the awake and agitated state.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the initial sections of the record, the patient is awake and moving about.  The overall background is quite disorganized.  Head rocking artifact is noted, but there was also an increase in amplitude in the right scalp electrodes particularly the right temporal regions.  When the patient is a bit more cooperative, is a bit more theta.  The nurses attempt to console the patient with little success.  At some point, there is an increase in beta as the patient's Versed starts to take effect and the patient started snoring.  As she does so, a more restricted area of focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant was noted and there are discernible, right occipitotemporal sharp waves noted.  The sedation does not last long and the patient is quickly agitated again.  The pattern from the left is also disorganized, but lacks the same quantity of arrhythmic delta activity.  The sharp waves are irregular with a variable maximum and can include T4 or O2.

Heart rate N/A.

IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging, but abnormal EEG due to:
1. Sharp waves from the right hemisphere, typically posterior temporal, but not exclusively occipital or posterior temporal, sometimes mid temporal.
2. Arrhythmic delta activity, right posterior quadrant.
3. Background slowing and disorganization from both hemispheres.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  This EEG supports a structural process on the right involving gray and white matter as well as a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.  Additional recording may be considered if the patient suffers additional seizures.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a routine 20-minute record with hyperventilation, photic stimulation, and impedance under 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is symmetric reactive alpha rhythm of 8.5-9 hertz, 30 microvolts.  It is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Drowsiness is characterized by a slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is a small amount of shifting slowing.  Other features of drowsiness include an increase in amplitude of the background.
Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing.  Photic stimulation elicited symmetric, bilateral driving.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is remarkable for significant muscle and movement artifact as well as muscle twitch artifact. There is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm identified on the left. The right hemisphere seems to have intermittently disrupted alpha and in fact subtle, generalized slowing as well as intermittent more marked slowing with some underlying slower mixed theta delta. Throughout the record, the tech attempts to decrease the amount of muscle artifact in the electrode with limited success. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. Unfortunately the muscle artifact persists.
Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response. Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Modest generalized background slowing.
Superimposed right focal slowing characterized by intermittent disruption of the frequency activity on the right.

electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR and no AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic
theta<<delta activity and diffuse frontally predominant polyspikes.  As the recording opens,
polyspikes are low in amplitude and infrequent. As the recording progresses,  they gradually
increase in frequency, amplitude and duration.  Clinically, they are associated with diffuse body
jerks.  Four brief (~20 seconds) clinical and electrographic seizures are captured.  Clinically patient
has diffuse body jerks that rapidly evolve into rhythmic clonic movements of upper extremities.
Patient is given vecuronium at the time of the last seizure, so no movement is identified with that
event.  Electrographically, the first 3 seizures are characterized by diffuse EMG artifact. Patient is
paralyzed at the time of the fourth seizure.  That seizure starts with moderate amplitude diffuse
polyspikes that evolve into a mixture of diffuse 8-10 Hz  activity with underriding low amplitude fast
activity.  At the end of the seizures, rhythmic ~ 3 Hz diffuse delta activity is seen accompanied by
the underriding fast activity.  After each seizure, frequency, duration and amplitude of polyspikes
decrease dramatically.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is no change in the background
activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.

INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system with one channel EKG.  The patient is intubated, but responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG is markedly abnormal, but demonstrates a continuous pattern.  The overall pattern is relatively suppressed from the right hemisphere with smaller amounts of alpha and theta frequency activity.  From the left hemisphere, arrhythmic delta activity was noted with occasional sharp waves noted in the left hemisphere including left mid temporal or central regions.  These are medium amplitude sharp waves.  There is also a small amount of wicket noted from the left.  This record does capture some drowsiness with an increase in beta frequency activity.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was a technically acceptable EEG with impedances below 5 kilohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the EEG is well organized.  There is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Somewhat irregular mixed theta delta was noted in the frontal central regions. It is present bilaterally, but is somewhat more prominent in the right hemisphere.
Hyperventilation was performed early on in the record and very quickly produces a feeling in the patient of dizziness and jitteriness.  Bursts of frontal theta are noted, somewhat irregular and a little bit more prominent on the right in hyperventilation.  Photic stimulation was performed immediately after hyperventilation, in the early parts of the record and did elicit a driving response.  The patient remained quite anxious and there is a great deal of muscle artifact noted in the background.  In this challenging EEG with a great deal of muscle artifact, there appears to be an underlying 4 hertz spike and wave complex, typically seen in the right hemisphere sometimes with a bihemispheric predominance.  Review of the video identifies no twitching of the patient during the discharges.
Heart rate:  66 bpm.  Frequent PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent rhythmic somewhat irregular theta delta noted in relaxed wakefulness, and somewhat accentuated by hyperventilation.
In this technically challenging EEG, likely an underlying spike and wave complex seen a bit more prominently in the right hemisphere, but sometimes of bilateral representation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to a previous study 5 years ago, the patient had 3-5 hertz frontally predominant spike and wave activity as well as right frontal spike and wave activity and right

INTRODUCTION:  Twenty four minute digital video EEG was performed

at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement

with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated, but was


examined during the EEG.  There was no record of the use of

sedative, hypnotic medications in the report provided by the

technologist.



DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a medium

amplitude pattern with a mixed frequency pattern.  There are


lower voltage theta and delta frequency activity.  Intermittent,




subtle attenuations were noted, with attenuation or at least a

decrease in amplitude of the background.  These effects last 1 to


3 seconds and are not entirely a burst suppression pattern.  In

the sections of the record with more vigorous cerebral activity,


there is right frontal delta.  There is also a lower voltage

right frontal fast wave or lower voltage frontal sharp wave noted

intermittently.  Rare left frontal sharp waves were also noted.

Tactile stimulation of the patient seem to produce an attenuation


of cerebral activity lasting 7 seconds in duration.

1. A low voltage slow pattern.


2. Intermittent attenuation of the background.

3. The phenomenon of attenuation of the background with tactile

right greater than left.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  The

cranial defect and may have been accentuated by that fact.  In

the absence of the use of sedative, hypnotic medications, the

background described above is a worrisome pattern.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:




The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9.6 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  There is a
small amount of background theta noted in wakefulness.  Age-appropriate, rare bursts of isolated right
or left temporal theta were noted





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not sustained



Aside from a small excess beta, No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Occasional wicket waves are noted during drowsiness over the temporal regions



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72-90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. mild excess theta for an adult of this age.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


No definitive epileptiform discharges were identified.  The mild excess beta may be due to this
patient's medications.  If further information is needed to characterize this patient's epilepsy, a more
prolonged study capturing sleep is suggested

A bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of alpha rhythm and normal low
microvoltage frontocentral beta and rhythmic theta. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and
reactive 10.7 Hertz 35-40mV posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with
eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Stage II sleep is identified but not sustained and is characterized by normal sleep transients, with
synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes, and abundant POSTS.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

There is occasional head rocking artifact and normal variant wicket rhythms identified

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

ERGOCALCIFEROL, VITAMIN D2, (VITAMIN D2 PO), Take  by mouth.

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 250 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.


metoprolol (TOPROL-XL) 25 mg 24 hr tablet, take 1 tablet by mouth once daily

olmesartan (BENICAR) 5 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily for 360 days.




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.



Most of the study consists of drowsiness.  During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation
and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.


Rare left temporal polymorphic slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) bilateral synchronous and independent (left > right) anterior to mid
temporal sharply contoured theta. This has an appearance most consistent with wicket waves, a
benign variant.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild rare left temporal polymorphic slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 1-hour EEG due to:




1. Rare left temporal polymorphic slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of left temporal cerebral dysfunction.

Sharply contoured theta waves noted over the bitemporal regions synchronously and independently
(left > right) are most consistent with a benign variant (wicket waves).
