INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 9 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  There are spontaneous arousals from drowsiness and then she drifts off to a drowsy pattern with slow rolling eye movements and a beta background.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces some head rocking artifact.  The head rocking artifact is most prominent in the posterior temporal region.
Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.
HR:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These results are the same as previous EEGs.  In this individual with longstanding, refractory epilepsy consideration for long-term video EEG monitoring is appropriate.

59 y.o. female with a history of childhood

epilepsy, colon cancer, obesity, and DVT presenting with


repetitive seizures and prolonged somnolence in the ED referred

for routine EEG for management of seizure exacerbation and

assessment of mental status change.




MEDICATIONS: Trileptal, Dilantin




SEDATION: None listed



TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a


symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).



There are occasional disorganized bursts of sharply contoured

diffuse theta and delta frequencies.




The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and


amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




Mild generalized slowing is present.

There is abundant sharply contoured left temporal polymorphic


slowing.

There is abundant independent sharply contoured right temporal

polymorphic slowing.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. Very frequent left temporal spikes (F7 > T3 max), activated by


sleep

2. Very frequent left fronto-temporal spikes (F7 > T3 > Fp1/F3

max), activated by sleep

3. Occasional right temporal spikes (F8 > T4 max), activated by


sleep; seen both independently of and synchronously with #2




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing


2. Abundant sharply contoured left temporal polymorphic slowing

3. Abundant independent sharply contoured right temporal


polymorphic slowing

4. Very frequent left temporal spikes (F7 > T3 max), activated by

sleep

5. Very frequent left fronto-temporal spikes (F7 > T3 > Fp1/F3


max), activated by sleep

6. Occasional right temporal spikes (F8 > T4 max), activated by


sleep; seen both independently of and synchronously with #2








CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of multifocal epileptiform


discharges (left temporal and left fronto-temporal > right

temporal), superimposed on bitemporal dysfunction and mild

diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

There were no electrographic seizures captured during this study.

INTRODUCTION: Digital  video EEG is performed in the lab using standard  10-20 system of electrode placement  with one channel  of EKG. Hyperventilation  and  photic  stimulation were performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.



DESCRIPTION OF  THE   RECORD: In  wakefulness,  the  background  EEG  is  symmetric,


continuous, and fairly well organized for age.  There is a 9 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant  alpha rhythm,  which  is  attenuated  with  eyes  opened.    There  is  a  small  amount  of  low  voltage, frontocentral  beta  activity.   As the tracing continues,  alternative  sharp  waves  in  the posterior region, as well as 3 Hz spike and slow wave activity were seen in drowsiness.  The 3 Hz activities repeatedly occurred  in drowsiness, lasting from 1 to 3.5 seconds without change in behavior. This activity seemed to emanate from the left central and temporal regions.   No clinical behavior was observed  on  the  video  can1era. Drowsiness  is  characterized  by  a  mixed frequency  of  brain activity,  but deeper stages of sleep  were not achieved.   Hyperventilation  mildly  increased  the slow theta activity on the background.  Post-hyperventilation, the patient became drowsy.  Photic stimulation elicits driving.

ID:  60BPM.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  alternative sharp activity in the posterior region.
2.   3 Hz spike and slow wave activity seen in drowsiness, repeatedly originating  from the left central and temporal areas- C3 and T3 areas.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This abnormal EEG reflects an underlying pathologic process of the brain and provides a partial mechanism for epilepsy in this patient.  The occurrence of 3 Hz spike and slow wave activity is a likely epileptogenic in origin and  bears clinical  significance. However,  the electric  artifact from  the VNS device should be excluded.    A repeat EEG  with careful attention to the VNS device is recommended.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  Early drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the alpha rhythm to 8 Hz.   Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, producing an increase in theta.  Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
There is a single abnormality identified in this record in the transition just as the patient is drifting off to sleep and it does seem to elicit an arousal.  This is a frontally predominant spike and slow wave complex with a poly spike and slow wave component reaching amplitudes up to 200 uV.  It is symmetric and frontally predominant.  The whole entire entity includes a burst of approximately one second without clear correlate, but with an alerting.
HR:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	An isolated, frontally predominant spike and slow wave complex.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In contrast to previous studies, this EEG demonstrated a relative paucity of epileptiform activity.  This may be due to the little sleep that was recorded in this record.  Of note, this patient has a history of prominent spike and slow wave activity in sleep.  The observation of an arousal in association with epileptiform activity may be part of this patient’s underlying sleep disturbance.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz, 30 to 50 V posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  The patient rapidly drifts into deeper stages of sleep with relatively symmetric, theta frequency activity as well as vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  In later stage II sleep, the background remains rich in beta frequency activity.  There are occasional bursts of shifting theta or delta.  Later stage II sleep is symmetric with abundant K complexes, spindles, and vertex waves.
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort producing symmetric slowing.  Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is asleep and no significant driving response is identified.
HR:  90 BPM, rare APCs.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits for a subject of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No significant focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  To further characterize this patient’s seizures, a repeat tracing with a more prolonged recording could be of use.

DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is slow and disorganized with primarily a theta frequency background and
a posterior dominant rhythm which is approximately7 Hz on the left, slower on the right. There is shifting arrhythmic delta
activity. There are also some bursts of sharply contoured slowing and sharp waves in the left mid temporal region.
Features of drowsiness include hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Shifting slowing a nd diffuse sharply contoured slowing on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
The sharply contoured slowing may be correlated with the history. The generalized background slowing and arrhythmic
slowing are compatible with a bihemispheric disturbance. Renal failure, and/or cerebrovascular disease can also
contribute to this picture. Previous EEGs were not available for review.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz, 50 to 70 V posterior dominant rhythm, which is higher amplitude on the right compared to the left.  There is also a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.
The major abnormality is some subtle, isolated focal slowing from the left temporal region with a mixture of primarily theta but a smaller amount of delta activity.  Other features in stage I and into stage II sleep are prominent POSTS, which are higher amplitude on the left, and at times there is an appearance of almost a very subtle posterior temporal focus of isolated 3 Hz activity.  In addition, there is a discrete sharp wave identified again in the left mid to anterior region, which is identified in drowsiness and into stage II sleep.  This is also elicited in apparent wakefulness around the time of photic in relaxed wakefulness.  It occurs over a background of relatively sharply contoured activity with the potential for a normal variant such as wicket, but there seems to be only this discharge from the left temporal region.  There is no other phase reversal on the contralateral side and there is a bit of focal slowing underlying this rhythmic, sharply contoured activity.  All discharges are relatively small and discrete, but again identified on one occasion in relaxed wakefulness and on rare occasions into stage II sleep.
Hyperventilation produces vigorous background delta.  Photic stimulation elicits symmetric driving. 	HR:  60 BPM
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Subtle, left temporal focal slowing seen primarily in the anterior temporal region but on some occasions in the posterior temporal region with a small discrete sharp wave.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9.25 Hz, 70 to 80 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, which dramatically increases the amplitude of the background and produces a small amount of bitemporal slowing.  Occasionally the bitemporal slowing shows shifting asymmetries and may be irregular.  On one occasion, it is sharply contoured and irregular on the left following A.B.   Features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha, slow rolling eye movements, and somewhat irregular, sharply contoured theta identified from the temporal regions, left greater than right.  Vertex waves are seen in stage I sleep.  During photic stimulation, the patient is drowsy and during this portion of the record, there are left temporal sharp and slow wave complexes with bursts of sharply contoured activity during photic.  No driving response is elicited and after photic, the patient drifts off to stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:







A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of poorly organized low to medium
amplitude and reactive 8-8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). A large amount of low to
medium amplitude frontally predominant 18-25 Hz activity is seen. Moderate amounts of eye blink,
muscle, and EKG artifact are seen.




During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm and diffuse
background slowing are seen.



Very brief stage II sleep is characterized by attenuation of muscle artifact and beta activity along with
increased amounts of bilaterally symmetric medium amplitude delta and theta slowing.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 58 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The awake background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  The most striking abnormality in this record is a high amplitude spike and slow wave, poly spike and slow wave complex identified from the right hemisphere with a generous field of spread including C4, P4, and T4.  The focal spiking may be intermittent, periodic, or occur in transient clusters.  When the spiking stops, the posterior dominant rhythm on the right is well defined and there are portions of the record where it is defined bilaterally.  As the patient becomes drowsy, the epileptiform activity becomes increasingly periodic and the EEG develops a small degree of discontinuity in sleep around the epileptiform activity.
Photic stimulation elicits primarily a photoelectric effect, but there is a suggestion of a driving response underneath that.
HR:  118 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal epileptiform activity from the right hemisphere with a relatively generous field of spread including the parietal, central, and posterior temporal regions.

attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is quite drowsy.  In maximum wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 40 to 60 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  As she becomes drowsy, there is an increase in background slowing as well as a more diffuse distribution of the beta activity and slowing of the alpha rhythm.  Intermittent LAMBDA is identified when the patient wakes up.  She is occasionally noted to snore and she drifts off to sleep.  Vertex waves and POSTS are seen in stage I sleep.  Snore arousals are identified.
Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine outpatient digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation was deferred due to the patient's pulmonary condition.  This is an awake and asleep record in a patient, who is very drowsy, dropping in and out of stage 2 sleep and falling forward to sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the EEG is well organized with a posterior dominant rhythm of 9.5 Hz.  As the patient becomes drowsy, the posterior dominant rhythm slows.  In the transition towards sleep, there are intermittent bursts of rhythmic slowing from the right hemisphere.  Features of stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  Multiple sleep arousals were noted.
The early section of the record demonstrates mu, but testing was not performed to confirm this.
Photic stimulation was performed as the patient was drifting in and out of stage 2 sleep, but did elicit a driving response.

There is no PDR, no AP gradient and no reactivity.  The background consists of attenuated slow
polymorphic delta activity and intermittent eye-blink-like deflections that correlate with brief
abdominal jerks that are seen on the video.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was minimal reactivity to
auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe
No reactivity
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 22-minute portable EEG due to severe diffuse background slowing and lack
of reactivity. These findings are indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient has a prominent craniotomy in the right frontal region.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG is markedly abnormal and slow.  In fact, the right hemisphere is not as slow as the left.  There is a 7 Hz alpha rhythm on the right.  The left hemisphere demonstrates lower voltage and slower theta.  The right hemisphere demonstrates a prominent breach rhythm at C4 with prominent accentuation of beta frequency activity.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a somewhat slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm of 7.5 Hz, 40 microvolts. There is excess background theta. There are occasional bursts of delta  typically in the right or left temporal region, more commonly in the right than the left. Some of these are associated with a sharp wave with field of spread  including frontotemporal and frontocentral. Those from the left are more typically temporal. In addition there is a small amount of temporal rhythmic theta from the
left. Features of drowsiness include accentuation of the temporal lobe features described above.
Other features include slowing and attenuation of the alpha. Photic stimulation elicits a modest driving response.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 8 to 10 Hz, 40 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  Hyperventilation produces diffuse paroxysmal slowing in the left temporal area more so than the right.  Following hyperventilation, the patient falls into stage I sleep identified by vertex waves with accentuation of the delta activity, left temporal area more than right with occasional sharp waves.  Photic stimulation elicits minimal driving.
HR:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Occasional left temporal sharp waves.
Hyperventilation producing left temporal slowing more than the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The above findings in this tracing are supportive of this patient’s seizures. If seizures are an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep would be useful.

TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and no photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




No generalized slowing is present.

Focal slowing was seen: This was more remarkable in HV but also seen in HV with intermittent brief
bursts of  theta /delta more in L fronto-temple.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and
produces slow activity, left more prominently than right .


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a very mildly abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG for an adult of this age:

1. Focal slowing, Left, greater than permitted for age.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This  routine EEG did not identify epileptiform activity. The focal features described above are
typical of those seen in cerebrovascular disease. This is the 2nd EEG for this patient without
epileptiform activity

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric and well organized.  There is a 10.5 Hz, 75 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  MU rhythm is seen with eyes opened.  Hyperventilation increased the theta activity.  Post-hyperventilation, the patient fell asleep, which is characterized by vertex waves and spindles.  During sleep, POSTS can be seen.  Photic stimulation elicits driving.
HR:  84 BPM.

Prominent wicket activity is seen in the temporal regions.  As the patient becomes drowsy, but in addition to the wicket, which is most prominent on the left, there is some sharply contoured slowing from the left.  Characteristics of stage II sleep include vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  In addition, the wicket-like activity persists into stage II sleep and is more clearly defined as a sharp wave or a sharp and slow wave complex, again maximum at T3-T1.
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort producing an increase in the amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: A single sharp wave in a single channel after arousal appears may have been an artifact.  To further characterize this patients’ epilepsy a follow-up study with more prolonged sleep may be helpful.  The excessive beta activity may be due to medications such as Phenobarbital.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded in stage I and stage II sleep.

Focal sharp waves seen frequently at F7/T1.
Focal slow waves seen almost continuously at F7/T1 throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:

Continuous slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy, with seizures likely arising from the left anterior temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which has a high correlation with a structural lesion in that region.  No seizures were seen.

system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric and reactive, with a fairly organized mixture of alpha, beta, and
theta frequencies, with fragments of a symmetric and reactive posterior dominant rhythm that
approaches 8 Hertz. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present
but suboptimal.




Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.

There is occasional left frontal polymorphic slowing.



There are frequent spikey waveforms over F7, F8 that appear most consistent with lateral rectus spikes.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization


2. Occasional left frontal polymorphic slowing

3. Tachycardia


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of the presence of left frontal dysfunction
superimposed on a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


Tachycardia is noted on a single EKG lead.



A call was placed to this patient's long term care facility to notify them of the tachycardia.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 9.5 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing an increase in background theta.  Features of drowsiness include hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing with vertex waves.  Vertex waves, spindles, K complexes, and POSTS were seen in sleep. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is relatively drowsy and does not clearly activate the record.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Intermittent background theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The theta described above is non-specific and may be due to this patient’s sedative hypnotic medications, postictal state, or underlying CNS process. No epileptiform features were seen.

TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.  Patient was reluctant to cooperate with the test.


MRI demonstrated:  Acute to subacute hemorrhage in the right parasagittal frontal lobe


and right basal ganglia with associated mass effect as above.. Encephalomalacia/gliosis in the left
anterior temporal and left frontal lobes with chronic blood products likely related to remote trauma.
Small focus of chronic hemorrhage in the left basal ganglia.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is actively abnormal and asymmetric.  It is characterized in asymmetry.  The
left hemisphere is slightly disorganized but with the posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz 30 uV.  There
is excess theta, intermittent arrhythmic delta activity and greater variability than anticipated in
wakefulness on the left.  The right hemisphere is characterized by significant disruption of the
posterior dominant rhythm, disruption of faster frequency activity and bursts of relatively rhythmic 1-3
Hz delta activity maximum in the frontal regions, sometimes occurring in bursts lasting 3-5 seconds



Generalized slowing is present.


Focal slowing is present.

Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in rhythmic frontal delta bilaterally

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No definite spikes


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


FIRDA.


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none


EVENTS: There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 121 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:




This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Marked slowing on the right with bursts of frontal delta


2. Bilateral slowing and disorganization.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:


The bursts of prominent, paroxysmal frontal delta are in the region of this patient's hemorrhage.
Because of the prominent paroxysmal quality, additional monitoring may be of value.

This EEG supports a structural abnormality in the right hemisphere, superimposed upon a
bihemispheric process, congruent with the findings outlined by imaging.  No seizures were recorded.
The issue of long-term monitoring was discussed with the ICU team.

Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well formed and modulated 9 Hz alpha activity that
attenuates with eye opening.  PDR is better formed and modulated over the left.  There is an
anterior-to-posterior frequency-amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes
anteriorly.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely,
followed by symmetric vertex waves.
There is continuous interhemispheric voltage asymmetry with lower voltages over the right.
Additionally, there is paucity of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere, especially over the
anterior and median quadrants.  Semi-rhythmic sharply contoured delta activity at 1-1.25 Hz is
observed over the right frontotemporal region during and following hyperventilation.  Occasional
right frontotemporal sharp waves are noted.  Maximal scalp negativity occurs over F8, T2, Fp2 and
F4 electrodes.  These discharges become more apparent during photic stimulation.  No clear
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) produces semi-rhythmic sharply
contoured right frontotemporal delta activity and accentuates right frontotemporal sharp waves.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric, mild-to-moderate, especially over

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 24-minute EEG due to mild-to-moderate right
hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the anterior and middle quadrants and occasional
right frontotemporal epileptiform discharges. Focal slowing and voltage attenuation over the right
is suggestive of focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology.  A potential epileptogenic
focus emanates from the right frontotemporal region.  Given accentuation of epileptiform
discharges and focal slowing with photic stimulation, this EEG is suggestive of photosensitive
seizures.  Please correlate clinically electrographic seizures are captured.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Ativan, Etomidate, Fentanyl, Versed, ROCURONIUM
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is starting to emerge from paralysis and demonstrates stiffening and movements.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is a bit quieter. Activity demonstrates a slow pattern with some rhythmic mixed theta and delta on the left with a lower voltage, slower, a bit more suppressed pattern on the right, particularly in the temporal regions.
Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting with an increase in muscle as well as alpha and theta frequency activity. During the EEG, the patient starts to wake up, move around, and cough. After this, there is a more alert pattern with more theta frequency and alpha frequency activity from the left, but the right remains quite slow. By the end of the record in this very sharply contoured record, there was a suggestion of underlying sharp activity versus part of the fast activity at F3. In addition, more sharply contoured slowing is seen at T4-T6.
HR: 84 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Nearly continuous focal slowing on the right hemisphere.
2. Occasional T4-T6 sharps and question F3 sharps as well.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe, bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function as would be expected following the use of sedative, hypnotic medications.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is poorly responsive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10Hz alpha rhythm identified on the left. Faster frequency activity is attenuated on the right. The patient is conversant with the tech. This patient has an event during the EEG. The event occurs at 10:08 a.m. It is characterized by staring, jerking of the head from side to side. The EEG is remarkable for some sharp waves and some motion artifacts. The sharp waves are seen in the right frontocentral region. There is significant muscle activity. The patient is conversant during the spell. No postictal slowing is noted. Photic stimulation elicits a brief driving response on the left.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the right.
2. An event during the EEG without impairment of awareness. Although there is some artifact, there are some discharges in the same region as the patient's sharp waves. While the event might not be considered a simple partial or a complex partial seizure, the motor activity observed may be linked to the epileptiform activity elicited from the right frontocentral region which could have produced the features described above.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake through stage II sleep record with photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is markedly sharply contoured with a 9 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm with prominent temporal wicket seen from either region.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is a prominent increase in theta frequency activity.  Vertex waves and spindles are seen in stage II sleep.  Photic stimulation is attempted, but the patient has drifted back into stage II sleep.   Occasional snore arousals are noted in the background.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient has an event during the EEG. Hyperventilation is performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Although the patient is markedly drowsy throughout much of the record, there is a 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta and theta.  Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort, producing an increase in the amplitude of the background.  At the end of hyperventilation, the patient has a single episode of both shoulders jerking at 11:37:07.  Slowly, at 11:53, she starts to have rocking of the head from side to side and then has rocking from side to side with alternating movements of the hands, with hands coming up and going down and then head rocking from side to side.  During this event, although there is some movement artifact, the EEG otherwise demonstrates an awake pattern.  The technologist interacts with the patient during the event giving her a code word.  The patient has multiple different behaviors during this episode including brief hyperextension of the back and then slow rocking from side to side.
Towards the end of the behavior, the tech uses a nasal tickle.  The patient looks apprehensive and at one point turns away just briefly, but doesn’t move substantially.  She does blink to threat during the event, and towards the end of the event, seems upset or angry and is staring away from the direction of the technologist.  As the technologist moves around the room, however, the patient can be seen to track the tech with her eyes.  After the event is over, the patient tells the tech that the only thing she can remember is that her name is [patient’s name].
HR:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Although the patient was initially quite drowsy, there is no epileptiform activity.  This patient had a complex and prolonged behavioral event without EEG change.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  This is this child’s third EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 6.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive.  There are portions of the record when the child is awake when the background is appropriately organized for age.
The major abnormalities in this record include complex epileptiform activity, which can be best viewed at fast paper speed of six seconds per page and/or average reference.  These include spike and slow wave complexes, which are high in amplitude and sometimes seem almost electropositive in the mid-temporal region, but in most of the montages are maximum at C3.  They are variable with some having a much more generous field of spread to the frontocentral region or left hemisphere and others more restricted.  They are picked up by volume conduction in the contralateral hemisphere.  In addition, there are some generalized frontally predominant spike and slow wave discharges, some of which are 3.5 to 4 Hz, but which are slightly irregular.  As the child drifts off to sleep, marked background slowing is observed and prominent, high amplitude slow spike and wave complexes are identified.  These are picked up in the frontocentral region, but more so on the left.
As the child drifts off to sleep, he is lying on his side, away from the camera and towards his mother.  Initially, he seems to have jerking forward of the head.  Subsequently, he seems almost to be having a salaam-like seizure as he drifts off to sleep, jerking towards his mother with his arms coming up a little bit.  This seems to elicit an arousal from sleep.  The epileptiform activity is high in amplitude, but some sections of the sleep record seem to demonstrate a sleep pattern that is remarkable for prominent attenuation of the typical morphologies in sleep with this high amplitude spike and slow wave pathology, most prominent in the frontal regions and again with an unusual field but with more of a predominance to the left hemisphere.  The child does fall off to sleep at 12:51.
HR:  114 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Prominent epileptiform activity with complex epileptiform activity, slow spike and wave activity, and focal spike and slow wave activity, but activity that on the whole raises concerns about a process involving the left hemisphere.
Concerns that the background activity in sleep is slower than expected particularly in the frontocentral regions, left greater than right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings must be correlated with imaging and clinical exam at this juncture.  They differ from the two previous EEGs, which were not successful in identifying epileptiform activity.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat poorly organized.  There is an 8 to 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm in a background with excess background theta.  There is a great deal of muscle and movement artifact and, in fact, the muscle is present even into sleep.  Underlying this, there is some intermittent arrhythmic delta activity sometimes sharply contoured in the left temporal region.  Vertex waves and spindles are seen in stage II sleep, but there remains a fair amount of muscle in sleep.  Hyperventilation is performed with poor effort, but does seem to produce both generalized rhythmic frontal slowing, as well as accentuating some of the focal slowing from the left.  Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving.
HR:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing and poor organization.
Superimposed focal slowing from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record, however, given the amount of muscle artifact noted in the background, if epileptiform activity is of importance, a repeat sleep record may be necessary.  No periodic changes were seen.  In this individual who was evaluated for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, not all individuals demonstrate the characteristic pseudoperiodic findings initially and additional studies over a 12 week period may be necessary.

Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Background voltages are low.  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low voltage beta activity that attenuates with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV,  18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  The majority of the background consists of low amplitude diffuse beta activity.   During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.   During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.   Frequent positive sharp waves occur bilaterally and independently in the occipital regions during drowsiness  and light sleep.
Occasional low voltage sharp waves are seen over the left fronto-temporal region (Fp1/F7/F3). A benign variant (BETS, benign epileptiform transients of sleep) cannot entirely be excluded.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates. A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate 54 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, occasional, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal 1-hour awake and asleep EEG due to: 1. Left frontotemporal sharp waves (Fp1/F7/F3). While these sharp waves are most likely epileptiform, a benign variant (BETS) cannot entirely be excluded. Of note, low voltage backgrounds are a benign variant in the adult population.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates essentially continuous pattern rich in theta frequency activity. Arrhythmic delta activity is prominent in the posterior regions, right more so than the left. Some of this is sharply contoured.

At 11: 30: 54: The patient is sitting comfortably and has a heart rate of 84. She has a coughing spell, feeling as if she cannot catch her breath, and as if she is about to lose contact. The coughing spell is associated with muscle movement artifact, followed by burst of high amplitude delta. The heart rate increases to 132 beats per minute.
By 11:31:44: the EEG has returned to normal, but the patient remains tachycardic and feels unwell. Additional coughing again produces some of the same artifact, and some burst of delta.
Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response. HR: 	84-132 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   The rhythmic mid temporal theta described above is a normal variant, sometimes referred to as psychomotor variant. The patient had 2 episodes of coughing, with an increase in delta. The physiologic conclusion would be that prolonged coughing is the results in a hyperventilation response with the same sort of entity as would be expected to see in hyperventilation in the lab.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are preformed. This is a 1 hour Sleep-Deprived EEG. Left craniotomy defect is observed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 hertz posterior dominant rhythm. A prominent craniotomy defect is observed with wicked from the left central temporal region. Underneath the wicked, there is a small amount of slow delta. Hyperventilation is performed  early on in the record accentuating the focal slowing. This is followed by drowsiness  with slow rolling eye movements. Vertex waves are observed in stage 1 sleep followed by arousals. Possible REM sleep is observed in this record in the sleep deprived 1 hour record with a characteristic  theta and lateral eye movements in a past who does not appear to be awake. This may have been associated with an arousal. An EMG monitor was not employed. In the extended sleep recording, there is vertex activity. There is alpha frequency activity picked up on the left more so that the right into stage 2 sleep which is an unusual finding in that is it sometimes seen on the right would not be considered a clearly pathological entity. Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.
HR: 	54 bpm
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Intermittent focal slowing particularly observed in drowsiness in the left central temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are a number of unusual features in this record including the possibility of REM sleep in a single 1 hour record. The REM sleep appeared to be fragmented.  Another usual feature was the presence of rhythmic alpha rhythmic activity from the left central temporal region into stage 2 sleep.
This could not be considered clearly pathological  as it was sometimes present on there right. In any case, the alpha frequency activity did not wax and wane as might be anticipated in an epileptiform  pathology
Given the presence of the metal plate, epileptiform  activity may be under recognized in this individual. The previous craniotomy and skull defect in this case provide a breech rhythm with accentuation of activity, but the possibility of that activity is masked could not be excluded. This individual did not experience any other his paroxysmal spells during the study.

performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing and increase in amplitude of the background as well as some rhythmic delta from the right hemisphere, but without disruption of the underlying faster frequency activity. As the patient becomes drowsy again, there is a subtle disruption of faster frequency activity with subtle rhythmic slowing in the right temporal region. This is seen with brief transitions into stage II sleep but deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. On one occasion, in the transition to sleep there are sharp waves with rhythmic slowing out of the right temporal region followed by an arousal period. Unfortunately, there is some wick-like activity at this same time and there are some additional more subtle sharp waves without the same faster frequency activity noted. Photic stimulation elicits a bilateral driving response. During photic stimulation, a well defined right anterotemporal spike in slow-wave complex is observed. Additional spike complexes are noted at the very end of the record, again right anterotemporal.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 1 hour Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International
10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically
satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG  and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.3 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  Maximal
wakefulness on the whole is relatively symmetric




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  Focal slowing is noted in drowsiness
with dropout of faster frequency activity in the right hemisphere compared to the left




Sleep is characterized by vertex waves and spindles.  Stage II sleep also includes some focality and
sleep morphologies are better developed on the left



Mild generalized slowing is present.

In drowsiness and sleep focal slowing is present on the right



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Photic Stimulation: Driving responses elicited, better on the left



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1.  Focal slowing in the right hemisphere noted in drowsiness and sleep



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



No epileptiform features were identified.  These study may be compared to previous studies,

This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is awake with a
well organized, 10.5 Hertz, 30 mcv posterior dominant rhythm in a generous amount of
low voltage, frontal central theta activity. The patient is noted to have a fair amount of
snore artifact as he drifts off to sleep. Vertex waves are observed in stage I sleep,
followed by arousals. Snore and muscle artifact obscure the right temporal electrodes
as the patient drifts off into sleep. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was attempted, but not completed at the patient's request.  Photic stimulation was completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  The waking background is intermittently interrupted by rhythmic theta which can be diffuse, frontocentral bilateral.  There are also shifting asymmetries noted.  The patient transitions rapidly in and out of stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.  In the transition in and out of sleep, rare mu activity was identified.  There is also some sharply contoured slowing in the frontocentral regions bilaterally.

Photic stimulation is performed as the patient transitions in and out of stage 2 sleep.  Scant driving was noted.  Heart rate 84 BPM with occasional PVCs.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1. Intermittent excess theta.
2. Mild background disorganization.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Disorganized background with non-appreciable posterior alpha rhythm. Background  shows a slow theta pattern throughout. At times in the record there are occasional periodic discharges seen in both hemispheres but of a greater intensity on the left. They are located mostly in the left parietal region and in the same region on the right and some are seen also in the temporal regions. These are not regular occurrences in the record and the patient returns to more of that slow theta pattern as it continues. During the record the patient is stimulated with an increase in muscle artifact and minimal response on the record of alertness. On the video there is some twitching seen of the left forearm, but there is no correlated EEG activity at this time in the record.

HR: 	66 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Slowing of the background  with mostly a theta pattern bilaterally; occasionally  delta.
2. 	Periodic discharges seen with the left greater than right maximum which occasionally occurs on the record.

CLINICAL  CORRELATION:  Arm twitching is seen on the video and is not consistent an EEG correlation for epilepsy. The periodic discharges are occasional and with a little bit more reactivity on the left than the right. This could be consistent with either structural damage or an encephalopathy  picture as well as the slowing of the background which is a non-specific  finding.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm was 9-10 Hz in frequency 30-50 microvolts in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Stage 1 and stage 2 sleep are characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm and slowing of the background and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact, and presence of posts, K complexes, vertex sharp transients, and sleep spindles.  There are also intermittent bursts of bitemporal slowing at F7/T3 and F8/T4 lasting for 1-2 seconds.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies, and results in a symmetric driving response.  Hyperventilation was performed and resulted in slowing of the background activity.

generous beta. She demonstrates stiffening of the neck and rocking of the head with an
awake EEG at 0:21. She is observed to stiffen at that time. She vocalizes. She sits up
and rolls her head around. The tech performs testing. At 10:22:09 she demonstrates
tremulousness, bobbing her head from side-to-side. Her behavior is characterized
primarily by picking her head up and then pushing it back as well as lifting arms up and
stiffening. The motor activity increases rather than decreases towards the end of the
seizure. The technologist instructs the patient to stop doing it and then asks tier where
she is and how she is-doing? The technologist tells the patient to lay Clown and ..he
does. The technologist then asks, where are you?, how are you doing?, what is your
name? Thirty seconds later the patient is able to answer these questions. Sternal rub is
performed at 10:23:13. The patient is responsive by 10:23:40 and is reassured by the
technologist. The EEG at this time demonstrates an awake pattern. Behaviorally the
patient seems fatigued. The remainder of the record demonstrates wakefulness and
drowsiness with symmetric, alpha rhythm and generous beta.

These are associated with fear.  Also, a feeling as if she is on a boat.  Patient was feeling almost back to herself.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, antidepressants, other medications (suboptimal adherent).
INTRODUCTION:  Extended, digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  The patient was somewhat symptomatic during the EEG, reporting disequilibrium.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the EEG demonstrates an awake pattern with a symmetric reactive alpha rhythm.  This is disrupted by intermittent bursts of rhythmic right temporal delta with admixed sharp waves.  The bursts of sharp waves and delta are on the order of 5-10-15 seconds in duration.  No alteration in the patient's motor or sensory symptoms were seen in association with these discharges.  The patient's responses are slowed, but the tech who spends 40 minutes with the patient, finds that the patient's responsiveness is not so significantly different than the sections of the record without the bursts.  As the recording concludes, the epileptiform activity is decreasing, but there remains some rhythmic right temporal slowing.  The sharp waves are significantly more discreet.
Photic stimulation was performed at the end of the record.  A driving response was identified.  In the final minutes of the recording, another more brief burst of right temporal sharp waves was noted.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Well-defined high amplitude right temporal sharp waves.
Bursts of rhythmic temporal theta.
Bursts of rhythmic slowing and sharp waves lasting between 5 and 13 seconds without significant change in the patient's clinical status.

TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




Diffuse excess beta activity is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.







EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

A single brief burst (~1.5 seconds) of high amplitude ~2.5 Hz generalized frontally predominant
moderate-to-high amplitude polyspikes is captured towards the end of the recording during stage II
sleep.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

DESCRIPTION  OF THE RECORD:  During wakefulness, there is a well organized posterior rhythm of alpha of 8.9 Hz. The patient is seen getting drowsy during the record and in the temporal region there was a mid rhythmic cyclic theta most likely of drowsiness which is a normal variant. 	waves are also seen in the record. Deeper stages of sleep were seen with vertex waves. During photic stimulation, the patient is seen falling asleep, falling in to stage 2 sleep. During hyperventilation there is an increase in amplitude. During the record, there is a question of small left temporal sharp waves.

HR: 	72 bpm

IMPRESSION: 	EEG within normal limits, but there is concern of this EEG due to:
1.	Small left temporal sharp waves, questionable small left temporal sharp waves.
2.	Mid rhythmic cyclic theta which is most likely a normal variant of drowsiness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:   There is no epileptiform activity seen on this record but there is suspicion in the left temporal region. Would advise further study with more of a T1-T2 montage to evaluate these sharp waves more extensively, and sleep deprivation simulation would be recommended as well. Would recommend further neurological following and the repeat of an EEG.

system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.2 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not sustained


Mild generalized slowing is present.- There is a small amount of background theta and the alpha is
slightly slow


Left temporal focal slowing is present.  This is characterized by occasional bursts of left mid temporal
mixed theta delta noted in hyperventilation and drowsiness.


There are less frequent but present isolated bursts of slowing noted from the right



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

WICKET, sometimes seen around the time of the focal slowing

ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.  The left temporal focal slowing was also noted
around the time of photic stimulation



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:

The Features described above are not uncommon in older adults with cerebrovascular disease.  In a
subject of this age, this is a nonspecific finding.  It is however, outside of the accepted range of
normal.  There were no epileptiform discharges. This routine EEG does not support or refute the

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is a one-hour sleep-deprived record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a well-organized background with 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient rapidly drifts in and out of sleep with POSTS. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, but the patient is drifting
into stage II  sleep. Spikey POSTS are observed in the abundant stage II  sleep record. In  the sleep recording, there is an amplitude asymmetry for the POSTS which are high amplitude and on one occasion a left parietal sharp wave.  Additionally, with this subtle asymmetry there is also noted asymmetry with more muscle artifact on the right. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is essentially asleep and does not significantly activate the record.

HR:	78 bpm


IMPRESSION: Questionably abnormal EEG due to:
1.  A single left parietal sharp wave.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:   The amplitude asymmetry of the POSTS is an acceptable variant. A single sharp wave is a nonspecific finding. It may represent artifact, and there are other artifacts noted in this record at this time.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 7-7.5 Hz in frequency, well-formed on the left side, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is 5-7 Hz diffuse theta activity noted during wakefulness.  There is attenuation and loss of faster frequencies in the right hemisphere, most pronounced in posterior quadrant with intermittent slowing in the left cerebral hemisphere.  The lethargic state is characterized by further slowing of the background and disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm.  Heart rate was 90 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal EEG recording due to:
Diffuse slowing of the background with theta activity seen in wakefulness.
Slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
Attenuation and loss of faster frequencies and also slowing in the left posterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings are suggestive of either metabolic, toxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of sedating medication or bilateral cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  Attenuation and loss of faster frequencies in the left cerebral hemisphere is likely due to the patient's history of stroke.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record.  No seizures is captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.  If clinically indicated, a continuous bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  the patient is very anxious with frequent eye blinking.  This is an awake EEG with photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is scant 8 Hz activity identified in the background.  There are sections of the record in which the alpha seems to be almost invariant on the right.  When the patient relaxes and the eye blinks stops, there is a clear asymmetry with disruption of the alpha rhythm on the left in comparison to the right, excess theta in the left hemisphere, and occasional left anterior temporal sharp and slow wave complexes.  These occur as the patient reaches stage I sleep. Photic stimulation occurs while the patient is blinking vigorously.  There is scant driving.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a vigorous, 50-70 microvolt 10 Hertz upper rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, fronto-central beta activity. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude data background. Photic stimulation elicits harmonic and spur harmonic driving. As the photic stimulation begins the patient looks to the left and covers her face. She has her hands over her eyes and appears to be crying. When the technologist turns towards the patient at 10:18:08 the technologist interacts with the patient who begins to have jerking. The patient exhibits pelvic thrusting and neck thrusting and involuntary jerkins. The jerking of the right arm persists even as the study ends at 10:21 but the patient is able to look and interact with the physician. The EEG demonstrates a normal awake pattern throughout the entire event. There is no spike in wave activity and a well defined alpha rhythm is observed.

INTRODUCTION:  A 20 minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is quite fragile, but awake.  He is responsive to questions.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The right hemisphere is low voltage and relatively featureless.  The left hemisphere is remarkable for a craniotomy defect, but also periodic, high amplitude delta activity with a left central parietal spike and wave complex.  The spike and wave complex is periodic in nature and has the periodicity of about 8 per 10 seconds.  There is a small amount of waxing and waning of the epileptiform discharge, but no clear ictal pattern.  Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta in the left hemisphere as well as eye movement.
Heart rate:  80 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
A continuous periodic discharge, which includes a spike as well as periodic delta from the left hemisphere, maximum in the central parietal region.
Markedly slow and suppressed pattern from the right with volume conduction of the epileptiform discharge on the left to the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The patient seems to be awake and interactive despite the discharge described above.  In addition, stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting response on top of the periodic complex.  The discharge described above may be a chronic finding or a post-ictal finding, but does not appear to be to be a true seizure.   Ongoing vigilance is suggested.

INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with acceptable impedances, although there is a prominent craniotomy defect.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background from the right hemisphere includes a low voltage, continuous, primarily beta frequency pattern.  The left hemisphere demonstrates a prominent breach rhythm.  There are bursts of rhythmic 3 to 4 Hz activity of 1 to 3 seconds duration.  Some of these are associated with a sharp waves.  The bursts of rhythmic slowing with left mid temporal sharp waves are more prominent as the patient became drowsy.
Heart rate: 54 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
A marked interhemispheric asymmetry.
A low voltage slow pattern from the right with primarily beta frequency activity.
A pattern from the left with higher amplitude delta, a prominent reach, and a left mid temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is one of many EEGs for this adult, who has been evaluated for status epilepticus and seizures.  The epileptiform activity today is primarily left mid temporal, which in some ways is similar to the continuous EEG monitoring.  A contrast to February 2015 EEG monitor, which identified epileptiform activity from the left hemisphere, but that epileptiform activity was much more prominent in the central parietal region.
This EEG continues to support a focal mechanism for this patient's seizures.  The epileptiform activity is in the region of the patient's head trauma.  The bilateral background slowing supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function.

epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Other, continuous, bitemporal rhythmic theta activity
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 24 minute EEG due to continuous rhythmic bitemporal
non-evolving theta activity. This could represent a sign of bitemporal focal cerebral dysfunction.
Ultimately, significance of this activity is uncertain.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a
routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:






The waking background is asymmetric.  The left hemisphere is slightly disorganized but with a
posterior dominant rhythm of 8 Hz, normal anterior-posterior gradient.  The right hemisphere
demonstrates a posterior dominant rhythm, when present of 9 Hz but with continuous, somewhat
arrhythmic delta activity noted in the right frontocentral frontal temporal regions with disruption of
faster frequency activity.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous sleep spindles and few K-
complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.  Continuous focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:      Photic Stimulation: No driving response was noted, the patient
seemed to be drifting off to sleep



EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION: Abnormal due to


1. Continuous right frontocentral focal slowing

2.  Mild disorganization on the left



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

EVENTS:  The patient had 3 events during the admission.  The first one occurred at 7:00 p.m. after the doctor asked her to raise and lower her hands, and breathe heavily.  The patient started complaining of a headache, later ringing in the ears and became unresponsive with the eyes twitching and rolling backwards with forced eye closure, and some trembling.  The patient also had complaints of some right-sided numbness before the episode started.  The patient remained unresponsive to verbal motor commands until about 7:06:28 p.m.  She had a second event at 8:53:40 p.m. with a similar presentation of eyes rolling back and becoming unresponsive to verbal commands, and then trembling lasting until 8:58 p.m.  At the end she cried just as she did in the first event.  Then she had a third event occurring at 9:53:08 p.m. lasting until 9:58:47 p.m. again with eye fluttering,  trembling and following commands, and afterwards crying.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a somewhat unusual background.  There are sections of the record with some 5-6 Hz posteriorly predominant activity with a 9 Hz mu rhythm.  The posterior dominant activity is slow, notched, and somewhat regular, suggesting that there may be an underlying somewhat irregular alpha subharmonic.  Prominent lambda confounds this picture.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.  The somewhat notched posterior predominant pattern is seen when the patient is awake, as well as she starts to drift into drowsiness.
Hyperventilation seems to accentuate underlying, posteriorly predominant slowing.
Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response.
Heart rate:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This must be considered an abnormal EEG due to:  Somewhat slow irregular theta frequency activity in the posterior regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Harmonic since subharmonics are normal findings, but there is clearly irregular posteriorly predominant theta that cannot be considered a normal variant.  This EEG differs from a previous EEG on January 4, 2013 which was a normal routine study.

of generalized irregular spike-and-wave and polyspike-and-wave discharges, lasting up to 9 seconds
(photoparoxysmal response).  This response is most pronounced at 5, 7, 9 fps.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.




HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

(1) very mild diffuse slowing

(2) several generalized frontally predominant spikes and wave complexes


(3) robust photoparoxysmal response



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are consistent with patient's known diagnosis of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.

TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and tactile /verbal  stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of an organized symmetric mixture of alpha
and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The
normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.   The background is
slightly disorganized with alpha ranging 9.5-11 Hz and excess theta. There is prominent beta.
Lambda may have been seen on the right.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric though infrequent
vertex waves, sleep spindles . Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Modest generalized slowing is present.


Shifting focal slowing is present. This includes focal delta, low voltage in the right hemisphere, in
sleep and some focal bursts of slowing in the left central region, in drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Rhythmic mid-temporal theta of drowsiness noted over the temporal regions/posterior temporal
regions



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: tactile and auditory stimuli elicit an alerting and alpha rhythm.

Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no clear PDR or AP gradient while the patient is awake. The awake background consists of a mixture of a low amplitude beta>theta activity with theta activity most pronounced over the left frontotemporal region. As the recording progresses, the background becomes more attenuated- this corresponds to initiation  of phenobarbital. Additional underriding fast activity is captured over the left anterior quadrant. Diffuse excess beta activity is seen. Continuous high amplitude rhythmic and semi­ rhythmic (PLEDs and quasi-PLEDs) up to 1 Hz sharp waves with aftergoing slow waves emanate from
the left anterior quadrant, most prominent over the F3 lead. Starting at -8:27 AM, intermittent left anterior quadrant seizures appear. They last - 25-60 seconds and have no clinical correlate. They occur at variable frequency throughout the recording, up to multiple times per hour (between 4-5 PM), ie, frank focal status epilepticus. Last clear seizure is captured at -2:07 AM. Electrographically, seizures start with rhythmic left anterior delta- theta activity that rapidly increases in amplitude and rhythmicity, decreases in frequency and spreads throughout the left hemisphere. Periods of brief background discontinuity and sleep-spindle-like waveforms (more visible over the left) are seen during sleep.

Description:

Brief waking background is characterized by low voltage Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is observed.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz

activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows

to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm

attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate

voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.

No focal slowing is present.  Intrusions of polymorphic theta and delta activity are seen during brief

wakefulness.  Similar theta and delta activity is noted during sleep.  No epileptiform discharges are

present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and patient falls asleep.

Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at

multiple flash rates.

This is a repeat 1 hour EEG in search of epileptiform abnormalities.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  A 1-hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was quite somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the overall EEG is low voltage with generous beta.  Scant alpha rhythm was identified.  In this low voltage record, in hyperventilation and drowsiness, there is a subtle, low voltage infrequent somewhat irregular, left temporal slowing.  In addition, there are rare bursts of focal slowing from the right temporal region noted following hyperventilation.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta, followed by vertex waves and K complexes, as well as spindles.
Notable findings in this record include a brief burst of slower, rhythmic 3 hertz delta activity from the left temporal region.  This is followed by a single, low voltage, left temporal sharp waves.  These findings are best visualized in an average reference.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Hyperventilation as described above.  Heart rate slightly irregular 90bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a subtly abnormal EEG due to:
A single, well demarcated burst of rhythmic left temporal slowing.
Very infrequent bursts of shifting lower voltage, temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Only, a single sharp wave was noted in this record.  In this particular clinical context, however, the single sharp waves may be considered as part of this patient's pathology.  No well-defined, higher amplitude spike and slow wave and sharp and slow wave complexes were noted.

SEDATION:


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and

photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a

low-voltage, mixed frequency but a symmetric and reactive pattern


with scant 9  Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal

anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is

present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mildgeneralized slowing is present.

Focal slowing is present.  See below


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Elicits rhythmic, focal slowing from the


left, particularly left frontal/frontotemporal


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which


is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Subtle left focal slowing characterized by a focal


hyperventilation response



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are frequently found in association with

structural abnormalities as described above.  This is one of many

EEGs for this patient who has a previous one-hour EEG and a

Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During brief stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and
symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Occasional polymorphic delta activity is observed over the left anterior temporal region, increasing
during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of <60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, moderate, left temporal, anterior
Sleep, stage 2, brief
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and briefly asleep 1 hour EEG due to occasional moderate left
anterior temporal focal slowing. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a
routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with excess of theta activity, and with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz
posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and
amplitude is present but suboptimal.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization


2. Abundant (>1/10s) bursts of occipitally-predominant generalized irregular spike- and polyspike-and-

CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of generalized epileptogenic potentials, or possibly an occipital
focus of irritability with rapid bisynchrony, superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces diffuse,

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, drowsy and asleep



HISTORY:

a 34 y.o. male with a history of possible diabetes, possible alcoholic hepatitis,
recent three-minute tonic-clonic seizure one month ago referred for routine EEG for characterization
of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

amLODIPine (NORVASC) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily.


SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically challenging
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:








The waking background is very low voltage, but symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of
alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior
gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  There is generous low-voltage
beta.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  Different electrode artifact is noted in
sleep




Sleep is characterized by spike in vertex waves, spindles and posts



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Elicits an increase in theta

Photic Stimulation: Patient is falling asleep but there is a brief driving response



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a technically challenging low-voltage but otherwise normal EEG.  There are no clinical or
electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


The low-voltage pattern is a nonspecific finding.  The excessive drowsiness may be due to sleep
deprivation.  Given the artifacts, , please consider a more prolonged study or at least a repeat study

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:








The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.
