INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 30 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  Hyperventilation does not activate the record.  The major abnormalities occur around the time of photic stimulation.  The tech starts to awaken the patient for photic.  A brief burst lasting just under one second is seen with high amplitude, sharply contoured activity without a really well-defined spike and slow wave complex, but with notched frontal activity.  Reviewing the burst with different montages, it seems to phase reverse slightly to the left.

1 seizure occurred in the EEG lab at 13:51.  This follows photic stimulation, but does not occur during photic stimulation.  The patient is resting quietly with her eyes closed.  As the seizure begins at 13:51:57, no clinical signs or symptoms are noted.  The technologist notes the change in behavior.  The patientÕs eyes open at 13:52:10.  The technologist asks the patient questions at 13:52:16.  The patient opens her eyes and swallows.  When asked where she is she replies that she is in the neurologistÕs office.  She remains somewhat confused in the minutes that follow.  The tech calls the patient at 13:52:39.   At 13:52:46, she sits, staring blankly, and then she starts to rub her eyes in her head.  The tech asks if she is okay.  At this point, when the tech is asking the patient questions, the seizure has ended and the patient is confused.

EEG characteristics of this seizure include the appearance of rhythmic theta frequency activity, which is more remarkable in the posterior regions.  This seizure seems to start with some low voltage fast activity and then some rhythmic theta, more remarkable in the posterior regions and perhaps maximum in the right posterior region.  Reviewing this seizure with a circle montage, seems to confirm a phase reversal in the right occipitotemporal region but also involving the right central region, nearly isoelectric Cz to C4.  The activity shows frequency evolution and seems to occur in two phases with secondary build-up at 13:52:19 with fast activity and more of a generalized appearance.  The activity ends at 13:52:51 as the patient starts to rub her head with postictal slowing.

HR:  96 BPM.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Complex partial seizure, which was difficult to localize and which may have had some generalized features at the start, but with some evidence of focality in the same seizure.
2. An unusual paroxysmal burst frontal in nature.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of an underlying seizure disorder.  There may be more than one contributing factor for this patientÕs seizures.  This EEG did not provide adequate localization for the seizures that this individual experienced.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Previous EEGs are not available for comparison.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in background slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  Of note, there is a single four second burst in photic stimulation where the patient seems to have had eye flutter, but looking at the eyes there is no discernable eye movement, and the activity is in the frontal regions with a somewhat different field of spread in the eye monitor in comparison to the patient’s other eye movements.  This burst is highly suspicious for frontally predominant notched delta as might be seen in generalized spike and slow wave activity.
HR:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This EEG is abnormal due to:
1.	A single, suspicious, approximately 2 to 3 second burst of notched frontal delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  The activity described above can be seen in a primary or secondary generalized process.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. This patient’s previous EEGs were available for comparison.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is a scant amount of background theta, compatible with age.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing a small amount of slowing. There is a single burst of notched slowing in the occipital regions, right greater than left, seen at the end of hyperventilation.  As the patient becomes drowsy, additional, sharply contoured irregular slowing is seen.  The burst identified is generalized, but there may be an underlying right temporal sharp wave associated with that burst.  Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving.
HR:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Very subtly abnormal EEG due to:
Two somewhat unusual bursts seen in the background with some localization to the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to this patient’s two previous EEGs, there is much less in the way of epileptiform activity, and the overall background is more consistently normal.  The epileptiform activity in this record was not well defined - really only suspicious underlying sharply contoured activity with the paroxysmal bursts.  These findings suggest an improvement compared to the first study.

INTRODUCTION: Digital  video EEG is performed in the lab using standard  10-20 system of electrode placement  with one channel  of EKG. Hyperventilation  and  photic  stimulation were performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.



DESCRIPTION OF  THE   RECORD: In  wakefulness,  the  background  EEG  is  symmetric,


continuous, and fairly well organized for age.  There is a 9 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant  alpha rhythm,  which  is  attenuated  with  eyes  opened.    There  is  a  small  amount  of  low  voltage, frontocentral  beta  activity.   As the tracing continues,  alternative  sharp  waves  in  the posterior region, as well as 3 Hz spike and slow wave activity were seen in drowsiness.  The 3 Hz activities repeatedly occurred  in drowsiness, lasting from 1 to 3.5 seconds without change in behavior. This activity seemed to emanate from the left central and temporal regions.   No clinical behavior was observed  on  the  video  can1era. Drowsiness  is  characterized  by  a  mixed frequency  of  brain activity,  but deeper stages of sleep  were not achieved.   Hyperventilation  mildly  increased  the slow theta activity on the background.  Post-hyperventilation, the patient became drowsy.  Photic stimulation elicits driving.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  alternative sharp activity in the posterior region.
2.   3 Hz spike and slow wave activity seen in drowsiness, repeatedly originating  from the left central and temporal areas- C3 and T3 areas.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This abnormal EEG reflects an underlying pathologic process of the brain and provides a partial mechanism for epilepsy in this patient.  The occurrence of 3 Hz spike and slow wave activity is a likely epileptogenic in origin and  bears clinical  significance. However,  the electric  artifact from  the VNS device should be excluded.    A repeat EEG  with careful attention to the VNS device is recommended.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  Early drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the alpha rhythm to 8 Hz.   Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, producing an increase in theta.  Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
There is a single abnormality identified in this record in the transition just as the patient is drifting off to sleep and it does seem to elicit an arousal.  This is a frontally predominant spike and slow wave complex with a poly spike and slow wave component reaching amplitudes up to 200 uV.  It is symmetric and frontally predominant.  The whole entire entity includes a burst of approximately one second without clear correlate, but with an alerting.
HR:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	An isolated, frontally predominant spike and slow wave complex.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In contrast to previous studies, this EEG demonstrated a relative paucity of epileptiform activity.  This may be due to the little sleep that was recorded in this record.  Of note, this patient has a history of prominent spike and slow wave activity in sleep.  The observation of an arousal in association with epileptiform activity may be part of this patient’s underlying sleep disturbance.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat slow in organization for a subject of this age.  There is an 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  There is snore artifact, but there is also arrhythmic delta activity picked up from either temporal region, independently, and occasionally bilaterally.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz, 30 to 50 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by prominent rhythmic diffuse theta activity particularly in the occipital regions.  Hyperventilation is performed out of drowsiness and seems to accentuate this activity as well.  There are rare bursts of higher amplitude more sharply contoured frontal theta at the close of hyperventilation and there is a single, discrete left anterior temporal sharp wave in the transition from hyperventilation to sleep.  As the patient reaches stage I sleep, there are slow rolling eye movements with attenuation of the alpha rhythm, vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.
Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is relatively asleep with features of stage II sleep identified during photic stimulation.  While there is a low voltage, symmetric brief driving response following photic stimulation as the patient drifts off to sleep, there are two bursts of symmetric, low voltage TFA.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG to due to:
Brief bursts of generalized paroxysmal fast activity identified following photic stimulation in a state of relative drowsiness.
A single left anterior temporal sharp wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is the third EEG for this patient.  The GPFA is similar to abnormalities identified on the October 5, 2000 EEG.  The 1994 EEG was normal, and the 2002 EEG identified some left 5 Hz activity from the occipital scalp region.  The major relevant difference between the two EEGs is the presence of a discrete, left frontal sharp wave.  This has been reported in the literature as part of the maturational process of a primary generalized epilepsy, but it could also be seen in the setting of a partial or focal epilepsy as well.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1  channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is 8Hz posterior dominant rhythm.
In hyperventilation and in drowsiness,  however, there is more rhythmic 5Hz background theta with almost a rhythmic 5Hz posterior dominant rhythm.
There are intermittent bursts of frontally predominant generalized spike and wave and polyspike and wave activity. These occur in hyperventilation and are of 3-5 seconds duration. They are seen post hyperventilation in bursts lasting approximately 3 seconds in duration. The last burst is seen at 120 seconds post hyperventilation as the patient transitions into sleep.  Additional bursts are seen in the transition to stage I sleep.  They do not clearly produce an arousal response, although the first burst is seen in the first transition to sleep.  Other features of stage II  sleep include spindles and posts.
Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.   On 1 occasion the spike and wave activity also seems to be associated with the photic stimulation.
Heart rate: 70 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Bursts of 3-5Hz frontally predominant spike and wave activity and polyspike and wave activity.
2.	Spike and wave activity seen in hyperventilation and 1 time photic stimulation.
3.	Rhythmic theta activity, greater than one might expect in wakefulness and early drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The primary epileptiform abnormality in this record is generalized spike and wave activity as was previously identified.  There are a number of other normal variants or mild abnormalities, including the prominent 5 Hz activity identified. There is also some psychomotor variant, which in this case is likely a normal variant.

DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background includes a 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive.  There is generous background beta.  Notable in this record is an occipitally predominant 5 hertz rhythmic discharge.  It is occipitally predominant and has at times almost a spike and wave complex.  It is typically more prominent in the right occipital region than the left, although on occasion, does appear to be a bit more prominent on the left.
The discharge is prominent at the midline with a slight predominance to the left.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation clearly accentuate this discharge.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.
Heart rate:  60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This was a fasting record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with symmetric, reactive 10 Hz alpha rhythm reaching amplitudes up to 70  V with posterior slow waves of youth. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and elicits initially subtle, left temporal sharply contoured theta, which is somewhat irregular.  There appears to be a sharp wave varied in this frontotemporal theta.  The sharp wave can be identified on three different occasions.  Review of this activity with reformatting suggests a maximum at F7 but on other occasions in the left frontal region.  As hyperventilation continues, there are bursts of synchronous, high amplitude rhythmic frontally predominant delta.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 12 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with an increase in faster frequency activity and then attenuation of the alpha with background theta.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.  Photic stimulation is remarkable for LAMBDA activity, but also some driving at faster flash frequencies.  Hyperventilation produces a generous burst of high amplitude, frontally predominant 3 to 5 Hz activity.  The patient reports feeling tingling in the mouth and hands during HV.  The data is re-reviewed with appropriate sensitivities and even with fewer channels per page to make sure that there is no underlying spike and wave activity, and none can be determined
HR:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG for an adult of this age in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The relatively fast alpha rhythm is not pathological.  There is a very vigorous, high amplitude response to hyperventilation, but there is no definite spike and wave activity.  In this individual with seizures a year ago, a repeat study with hyperventilation may be of value.  Alternatively, comparison with childhood EEGs may provide the same information.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz, 50 to 70 V posterior dominant rhythm, which is higher amplitude on the right compared to the left.  There is also a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.
The major abnormality is some subtle, isolated focal slowing from the left temporal region with a mixture of primarily theta but a smaller amount of delta activity.  Other features in stage I and into stage II sleep are prominent POSTS, which are higher amplitude on the left, and at times there is an appearance of almost a very subtle posterior temporal focus of isolated 3 Hz activity.  In addition, there is a discrete sharp wave identified again in the left mid to anterior region, which is identified in drowsiness and into stage II sleep.  This is also elicited in apparent wakefulness around the time of photic in relaxed wakefulness.  It occurs over a background of relatively sharply contoured activity with the potential for a normal variant such as wicket, but there seems to be only this discharge from the left temporal region.  There is no other phase reversal on the contralateral side and there is a bit of focal slowing underlying this rhythmic, sharply contoured activity.  All discharges are relatively small and discrete, but again identified on one occasion in relaxed wakefulness and on rare occasions into stage II sleep.
Hyperventilation produces vigorous background delta.  Photic stimulation elicits symmetric driving. 	HR:  60 BPM

INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent throughout.  This was a somewhat technically challenging record due to background muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is low voltage, and relatively featureless with slow, low-voltage delta.  In this low-voltage pattern, there is a suggestion of a little bit more slow delta in the right posterior quadrant but there is also some head-rocking artifact.  Low amplitude, rare, discrete sharp waves were noted in the right mid temporal region with on rare occasions an after going slow wave.
Tactile stimulation of the patient produced moaning and stiffening.
Heart rate 67 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a low voltage, slow pattern.
A suspicious, rare, low voltage, right temporal sharp waves in the context of a low voltage background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is most supportive of the significant, diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting gray and white matter such as a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy or pharmacologic effect.
The subtle temporal sharp waves raise the possibility of a localization-related mechanism for seizures.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in Children’s Hospital using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake EEG in a child who becomes only briefly drowsy. Overall cooperation is fair.  The child’s mother was at the bedside, attempting to hold the child’s eyes closed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is medium to high amplitude.  The overall organization is slightly outside the range of normal for a child of this age, despite movement artifact.  Prominent frequencies in the background include theta frequency activity.  On one or two occasions, there seems to be LAMBDA activity from the occipital regions bilaterally.  There is a subtle asymmetry with some arrhythmic delta activity in the right posterior temporal region and a triangular shaped or triphasic shaped discharge from the right posterior temporal/occipital region.  On rare occasions, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of faster frequency approximately 6 to 7 Hz identified.  While this is symmetric on some occasions, on other occasions it seems to be better represented on the left compared to the right. Brief drowsiness is characterized by a decrease in movement. As the child makes the transition to drowsiness, initially the posterior dominant rhythm seems symmetric and then there seems to be a subtle delta from the right posterior quadrant.
HR:  120 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for a child of this age due to:
Mild background slowing without some of the anticipated features of organization expected at this age.
Subtle focal slowing with an almost triphasic-like component in the right posterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Generalized background slowing is non-specific and may be related to either a postictal state, medications, or an underlying disorder of cerebral function.  Correlation with imaging may be helpful to further evaluate the changes in the right posterior temporal region.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9.25 Hz, 70 to 80 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, which dramatically increases the amplitude of the background and produces a small amount of bitemporal slowing.  Occasionally the bitemporal slowing shows shifting asymmetries and may be irregular.  On one occasion, it is sharply contoured and irregular on the left following A.B.   Features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha, slow rolling eye movements, and somewhat irregular, sharply contoured theta identified from the temporal regions, left greater than right.  Vertex waves are seen in stage I sleep.  During photic stimulation, the patient is drowsy and during this portion of the record, there are left temporal sharp and slow wave complexes with bursts of sharply contoured activity during photic.  No driving response is elicited and after photic, the patient drifts off to stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.
HR:  70 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Left temporal spike and slow wave and sharp and slow wave complexes with associated focal slowing elicited in proximity to but not by photic stimulation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In contrast to previous EEGs, this is the first EEG that demonstrates epileptiform activity.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There is a 7 Hz, 30 to 60 V dominant rhythm.  Intermittent bilateral as well as unilateral right focal slowing is characterized by frontal theta and delta.  There is a right frontal breech demonstrated by increased beta and increased amplitude of theta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there are more prominent bursts of frontal slowing and a breech on the right.  Although the EEG is abnormal, it is nearly symmetric and well organized at times. Hyperventilation produces right frontal delta.  Photic stimulation elicits symmetric driving.  There is no EEG change at the time of twitching.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm of 30 uV with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in rhythmic theta followed by one or two vertex waves.  There is a suggestion of a breach rhythm in drowsiness, which is higher amplitude theta in the frontal regions.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, producing an increase in the amplitude and a small amount of rhythmic slowing.  Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The vast majority of the record is drowsy with a mixture of theta and beta frequency activity.  In this state, there is rare, subtle left frontotemporal slowing.  Sometimes this is picked up bilaterally in the frontal regions.  On occasion, this is associated with a discrete, left frontotemporal sharp wave maximum at F7 and T1, sometimes appearing as a couplet.  Features of deeper stages of sleep include vertex waves and spindles.  As the patient reaches stage II sleep, the EEG becomes more symmetric and more synchronous.  There are rare left anterior temporal sharp waves in stage II sleep.  These discrete discharges persist throughout the light sleep record.  In maximal wakefulness, the patient arouses and the EEG becomes well organized, symmetric with a low voltage, symmetric reactive 10.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of frontocentral beta activity.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial portions of the record, there is a marked intrahemispheric asymmetry.  From the left hemisphere, there is a 9.5 Hz, 35 V posterior dominant rhythm.  This is somewhat disrupted on the right, and the right hemisphere demonstrates disruption of faster frequency activity with arrhythmic delta activity particularly from the centrotemporal regions and T2 sharp and slow wave or spike and slow wave complexes. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and seems to accentuate this pattern. As the post-hyperventilation pattern resolves, the focal slowing becomes somewhat less prominent and the intrahemispheric asymmetry slightly less marked.  Later on, as the patient drifts into stage I and stage II sleep, there is again disruption of faster frequency activity particularly from the right frontal regions. Symmetric vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles are identified in stage II sleep.
Photic stimulation elicits brief driving bilaterally at faster flash frequencies.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz, 60 V posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In this sharply contoured background, there are occasional left anterior temporal sharp and slow wave complexes with associated focal slowing.
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort producing occasional slowing from the temporal regions independently or bilaterally.  Following this, the patient becomes drowsy.  POSTS are seen in early stage I sleep.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.
Photic stimulation elicits symmetric driving.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
1.	Left temporal sharp waves with suspicious sharply contoured slowing from the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In the sharply contoured background, consideration for a study with more extensive sleep may be helpful to further delineate epileptiform activity from the background.

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only





HISTORY:

a 41 y.o. male with a history of seizures (last in), referred for routine EEG
for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


divalproex (DEPAKOTE) 500 mg EC tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily. Indications:
EPILEPSY

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and an excess
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only routine EEG, remarkable only for excess of beta frequencies.  There are
no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.





CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.



If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.

Excess beta activity may be seen in the setting of a medication effect (i.e., benzodiazepines,
barbiturates).

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were attempted.  The patient spoke no English and had no caregiver to help translate. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial portions of the record are well-organized with a 9.25 Hz, 40 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In the initial portions of the record, the patient is a bit drowsy and hyperventilation is attempted.  There are bursts seen in this portion of the record in the temporal regions.  There are irregular bursts, which appear in the left or right temporal regions, sometimes a bit more on one side than the other or starting on the left and going to right or vice versa.  With the use of the T1-T2 electrodes, the activity appears to be maximum at T1 and there is an underlying sharp wave at T1-T3.  This becomes more prominent in the later HV recording. In these bursts, there are also T2 sharp waves and a sharply contoured background.  Following hyperventilation, as the patient becomes drowsy, there are additional sharp waves again seen at T1.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in the irregular temporal theta and the occasional sharp waves.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Irregular temporal slowing with an unusual field of spread often involving both temporal regions but asynchronous.
Left greater than right temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy.  If further characterization of this patient’s epilepsy is needed, an additional recording capturing sleep or one of her seizures would be helpful.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10.4 Hz, 50 to 60 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm followed by attenuation of the alpha with a handful of vertex waves.  In the transition to sleep, there are some bursts of mixed rhythmic theta and delta, which are somewhat irregular but not epileptiform in nature.  An identical 3-second burst is seen at the close of hyperventilation.
At the close of the record, wicket activity is identified in the transition to and from sleep, which is somewhat asymmetric, a little bit more prominent on the left than the right.
HR:  68 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The somewhat unusual response in hyperventilation and seen with a paroxysmal, somewhat irregular burst in HV and on one occasion in drowsiness, is not epileptogenic in nature and is of unclear clinical significance.  The asymmetric wicket described above is a normal finding.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is fairly organized with low voltage.  There is a 9 Hz, 15 V posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of frontocentral beta activity.  Frequent vertex waves, spindles, and K complexes were identified.  The patient was awakened by his snoring, but he rapidly went back to stage II sleep.  Moderate muscle activity is seen with snoring.  Photic stimulation elicited mild driving.

Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
There is intermittent focal slowing noted over the left hemisphere, fronto-temporal region.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces a modest, symmetric photic
driving response.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy due to intermittent left frontotemporal focal
slowing. No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically
indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.  Focal slowing
may indicate a structural brain lesion.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is mainly a drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is drowsy throughout much of the record.  There is a low voltage, 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage beta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in theta.  There is intermittent, irregular theta activity in the left temporal regions, left greater than right, with a subtle, sharply contoured slowing seen in the same region.  On rare occasions, there is some bitemporal slowing with some sharply contoured activity on the right. Features of stage II sleep include vertex waves and spindles.
Photic stimulation produces a minimal bilateral driving response.  The patient was drowsy through photic.  Hyperventilation is performed with poor effort.  The temporal features are identified in hyperventilation, which is almost equivalent to a drowsy state for this individual.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The major abnormality in this record are bursts of frontally predominant, well formed, high amplitude 3.5 to 5 Hz spike and slow wave activity.  A typical burst duration is three seconds, but bursts can be seen that are longer, up to 5 seconds including some that have some theta.  In addition, there are rare, subtle frontal  spike and wave complexes, a handful of which are maximum in the right frontal region or the left and which appears as a couplet with first one in the left and the second in the right or vice versa.  The epileptiform activity is clearly accentuated in hyperventilation and in early drowsiness.  Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved.
Photic stimulation elicits a photoparoxysmal response with brief bursts of high amplitude frontally predominant 4 to 6 Hz spike and slow wave activity.  None of the bursts last the duration of the stimulus and in one occasion the burst is seen following HV.  There is a single burst of 5 Hz spike and slow wave activity immediately following hyperventilation.
HR:  72 BPM.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake and drowsy record. No clinical seizures were recorded.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:






A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Synchronous and symmetric vertex waves are seen in sleep; stage II transients are not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) bursts of generalized, frontally predominant 5-Hz spike- and polyspike-
and-wave activity are seen in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Discrete bursts last up to 3 seconds but
occasionally occur <1 second apart, for a total duration of 5.5 seconds. In drowsiness spikes may
fragment, with equal predominance seen between the hemispheres.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produced
a single 1-second burst of diffuse sharply contoured theta activity.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces scant
symmetric photic driving, particularly at 9 Hz, which is a normal finding. There is no increase in burst
duration/prevalence during photic stimulation as compared with the rest of the study. There is no
photoparoxysmal response.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11.3 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with amplitudes of 50 to 80 V.  There is a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is frequent eye blink artifact.  As the patient gradually becomes somewhat drowsy, there is an increase in background beta, but deeper stages of sleep are not achieved.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 30 to 50 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. In wakefulness, on rare occasions, there is a small amount of discrete beta activity from the right temporal region.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and again produces a small amount of discrete, rhythmic theta activity.  Some of this is identified in the posterior regions on the right and measures at 6 Hz.    As hyperventilation continues, there are one or two bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta activity from the temporal regions.  Following hyperventilation, there is some EKG artifact in the right temporal region.  Despite this, there is subtle, discrete right temporal slowing and a handful of tiny, discrete right temporal sharp waves, which can be differentiated from the patient’s EKG and are identified in quiet wakefulness.
Photic stimulation elicits brief driving.  At the close of the record, just following hyperventilation, intermittent bursts of background slowing with vertex waves and K complexes are identified followed by arousals, supportive of stage II sleep.

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz


posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening. Note that there is very frequent muscle


artifact obscuring frontal leads during wakefulness.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no


clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.  Note

that there is very frequent muscle artifact obscuring frontal


leads during wakefulness.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The awake background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  The most striking abnormality in this record is a high amplitude spike and slow wave, poly spike and slow wave complex identified from the right hemisphere with a generous field of spread including C4, P4, and T4.  The focal spiking may be intermittent, periodic, or occur in transient clusters.  When the spiking stops, the posterior dominant rhythm on the right is well defined and there are portions of the record where it is defined bilaterally.  As the patient becomes drowsy, the epileptiform activity becomes increasingly periodic and the EEG develops a small degree of discontinuity in sleep around the epileptiform activity.
Photic stimulation elicits primarily a photoelectric effect, but there is a suggestion of a driving response underneath that.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal epileptiform activity from the right hemisphere with a relatively generous field of spread including the parietal, central, and posterior temporal regions.

MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Posterior slow waves of youth are seen and there are one or two brief epochs where the child has just a single burst of a vertex wave, a bit of drowsiness, and then immediately returns to wakefulness.
The major abnormalities in this record are elicited in hyperventilation and include a frontally predominant 3 to 5 Hz spike and slow wave discharge lasting less then three seconds in duration, typically on the order of 1 to 1.5 seconds in duration.  This is seen in hyperventilation and in the minutes that follow hyperventilation.  After this, the patient becomes drowsy.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, there is some slowing of the background.  Some of the features seen in the initial portions of the record with a microscopic lead are seen again, sometimes with a parietal maximum.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  In the interburst interval again, the activity in the parietal region PZ is identified.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized frontally predominant spike and slow wave and poly spike and slow wave complexes of 4 to 5 Hz in duration, all brief, seen primarily in hyperventilation.
Focal transience seen in the parietal region, PZ and occasionally P3.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is similar to this child’s first EEG and contrast from the last two did not demonstrate epileptiform activity.  The parietal activity seen may be an unusual manifestation of the generalized discharge, or a separate, focal feature. The PZ/P3 findings described above may not necessarily change the classification of this child’s epilepsy syndrome.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a symmetric, reactive 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In apparent wakefulness, hyperventilation, and early drowsiness, there is subtle, left temporal focal slowing.  There is a single left temporal sharp wave identified early in hyperventilation.  Vertex waves are seen in brief stage I sleep, but stage I sleep is not sustained.  Photic stimulation elicits symmetric, bilateral driving.
HR:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Subtle left temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In that only a single sharp wave was identified, additional EEG recording may be useful to clearly define this patient’s epileptiform activity.  Alternatively, comparison with her childhood EEGs may be of use. This tracing supports a structural or functional abnormality on the left.

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm.
Mu activity is identified. There is a very subtle asymmetry with a bit more rhythmic theta
noted in the right central temporal region compared to the left. In addition, occasional
well defined 70 microvolt sharp waves are noted, maximum at T2 and FS. These seem
to be accentuated by drowsiness. As the patient becomes drowsy, some sections of the
drowsy record include a more synchronous background. Photic stimulation does not
activate the record.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right anterior temporal sharp waves.
2. Rhythmic slowing from the right central temporal region.
3. Mild excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to two previous studies, this is the first EEG
which demonstrated epileptiform activity. The overall background is perhaps slightly
slower and disorganized compared to the previous study in 2007.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. Of note, the patient was experiencing a feeling as if he was about to have one of his attacks on the day of this study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm of 50 uV with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The overall waking background is well organized. On one occasion in drowsiness and during hyperventilation, there are occasional, brief bursts lasting one to five seconds, typically on the order of three seconds, of slightly irregular theta.  Particularly during hyperventilation, the theta seems to be a bit more prominent on the right with disruption of the posterior dominant rhythm on the right. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.
The patient experiences an ongoing feeling throughout the EEG as if he is about to have one of his spells and at 14:39 he reports pressure in his right leg. He reports to the tech at 14:47 that the right leg feels numb at that time.  No EEG changes are seen in association with these symptoms, and the brief bursts of slightly irregular slowing are not seen at the specific times that the patient reports his symptoms.
HR:  68 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
Brief bursts of slightly irregular theta, which during hyperventilation seem to disrupt the alpha rhythm on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen in this record.  The brief bursts of slightly irregular theta are a non-specific abnormality and may be correlated with neuroimaging.  The symptoms that this patient experienced were not associated with a change in the EEG.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1  channel of EKG. The date of this patient's seizures is not provided.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness background EEG includes an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm on the right, disrupted on the left. The left hemisphere includes arrhythmic delta activity with a high amplitude periodic sharp wave, maximum at T2 with a generous field of spreading involving the total of T3, T5 and F7. As the recording continues and the patient is stimulated this arrhythmic delta activity in the sharp waves waxes and wanes. The sharp waves may occur in bursts and trains but none last more than 10 seconds. The patient drifts into stage  1  sleep with vertex waves. The focal sharp wave contoured delta, focal slowing and sharp waves persist. There is a generous field of spread both for the sharp waves and to the focal slowing. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving, more so on the right.
HR:	72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Prominent focal slowing from the left temporal region.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In the transition to drowsiness, there is occasional temporal wicket, but there is a suspicious, underlying right temporal sharp wave identified in early drowsiness.
As the patient emerges to and from sleep, there is some rhythmic frontal mixed theta and delta, which is on the whole symmetric, although on one or two occasions there is a suggestion of maximum on the right.  Stage II sleep is characterized by vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  On two occasions, there are bursts of rhythmic frontally predominant, paroxysmal activity.  On one occasion, this occurs in the setting of hyperventilation and there seems to be some underlying eye blink, but there is suspicious, 3 to 5 Hz frontally predominant spike and slow wave and poly spike and slow wave activity followed by a more clearly defined eye blink.  The second burst occurs with the transition to sleep.  Again, the burst is less than two seconds long with approximately 5 Hz frontally predominant spike and wave/poly spike and wave activity.  No eye blink can be seen at this time, although the activity is picked up on the eye monitor at the midline.

TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG HV, and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive low amplitude  10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR),
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:





Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.




Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, antihypertensives, and others.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the Neuro ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is continuous and symmetric with generalized slowing.  There is a 7 to 8 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm, which is well attenuated with eyes opened.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Soon after the EEG commences, the patient began to shake her left arm and then both arms and hands on her abdomen.  The shaking was in a different direction at different rhythms.  The patient could open and close her eyes and follow commands during this episode.  Alternatively, when her left-hand shaking stopped, she began to open and close her legs with shaking, left side worse then the right.  With the prolonged episode, muscle movement artifact can be seen, but no significant EEG changes or correlates were found.  On the video camera, several doctors were called to see the patient.  The patient can open and close her eyes, follow commands, and lift her arms and legs up.  Interestingly, the patientÕs episodes spontaneously subsided if no one paid attention to her and she responded to a placebo of saline injection.  Throughout the EEG, there were no epileptiform discharges, but occasionally sharply contoured delta activity in the left central area is seen.

HR:  116 BPM.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Diffusely slow background.
2. Occasional sharply contoured delta in the left central area.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The diffusely slow background, as well as occasional sharply contoured delta activity in the left central area may be suggestive of an underlying pathological process in this patient, which is commonly seen in patients with hypertension and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.  This finding can also be seen in patients with subdural hematoma.  During the tracing, the patient had prolonged episodes of arm or leg shaking without EEG change, as well as being responsive to commands.  This is suggestive of non-epileptic seizures.  These findings were communicated with the primary neurosurgery team.  If epilepsy is a clinical concern or clinically indicated, when the patient is more stable and cooperative, a repeat EEG in the lab with full activation including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, as well as capturing deeper stages of sleep may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the/at the lab/bedside? using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The vast majority of the waking record is poorly organized, although at the very end of the record, the background EEG is actually reasonably well organized with a low voltage pattern and a 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  In the early portions of the record, when the patient appears to be awake, the background EEG is moderately disorganized with some shifting slowing.  There is also some temporal wicket activity seen.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and elicits rhythmic bursts of frontally predominant, high amplitude delta, which are quite prominent.  In addition, underlying this, there are some right temporal sharp waves.  In the post-HV recording, there is an underlying right temporal sharp and slow wave activity.
Photic stimulation elicits a photoelectric artifact only.
HR:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Despite the technical limitations described above, this EEG is abnormal due to:
Right temporal sharp waves.
Shifting arrhythmic delta activity seen particularly in the initial portions of the record.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a partial mechanism for this patient’s epilepsy.  The dynamic changes with improvement in the organization towards the end of the record may be part of this patient’s recovery from some sort of acute disturbance, which may be postictal, metabolic, or post-syncope. With a prominent frontal delta in HV, this is a non-specific finding and comparison with previous studies may be valuable.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz, 30 to 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm. In wakefulness, there are occasional, high amplitude left anterior temporal spike and slow wave complexes.  These reach amplitudes well over 100 uV and are preceded and followed by focal slowing.  There is intermittent left mid-to-anterior temporal focal slowing seen in brief bursts lasting less than one second with a mixture of delta and theta frequency activity, as well as a disruption of alpha frequency activity.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is also some rhythmic left temporal theta identified. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background beta, as well as attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  The drowsy record is primarily recorded in referential montage, and the left anterior temporal spike and slow wave complexes can be identified in this montage.
Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.  The epileptiform discharges are also seen in photic stimulation, but are not clearly accentuated by this procedure.
HR:  66 BPM.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, oxazepam, Lamictal, citalopram, lithium.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm is 8.5-9 Hz in frequency, 30-35 microvolt in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is 7-7.5 Hz diffuse theta activity seen during wakefulness, which is distributed symmetrically.  There is presence of stage 1 sleep characterized by disappearance of alpha rhythm, slowing of the background activity and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves.  Brief stage II sleep was captured characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and did not result in a driving response.  Hyperventilation was also performed and results in diffuse slowing of the background activity.  Heart rate was 70-80 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to excess theta activity during wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings could be due to toxic, metabolic, hypoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of sedating medication or bilateral cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures are identified in this record.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.  If clinically indicated, a repeat sleep deprived EEG or continuous bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is abnormal. The right hemisphere is relatively well organized with a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz, 30 uV.  The left hemisphere demonstrates intermittent arrhythmic delta activity seen occasionally in wakefulness, accentuated by hyperventilation, maximum in the temporal region.  There are a handful of left anterior temporal sharp waves identified in hyperventilation in the bursts of rhythmic slowing.  Following hyperventilation, as the patient becomes drowsy, the focal slowing from the left is accentuated.  On one occasion there is a train of sharp waves identified from the left temporal region, as well as a single right temporal sharp wave.  These can be differentiated from the patient’s EKG artifact.   On some occasions, there is a somewhat periodic left temporal sharp wave picked up, but mixed in this discharge there will be a subtle right anterior temporal sharp wave.  Vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles are seen in stage II sleep.  The epileptiform activity appears to decrease in stage II sleep.
Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving at faster flash frequencies.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz, 80 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a modest amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing a small amount of slowing as well as increasing the amplitude of the background.  At the end of hyperventilation, there is a single burst of arrhythmic delta seen first on the left and then on the right.  Following this, the patient becomes drowsy with an increase in background beta as well as occasional vertex waves.  Stage II sleep is characterized by vertex waves, K complexes, and POSTS with intermittent arousals from sleep.  As she awakens from sleep for photic stimulation, a hypersynchronous pattern is identified.
Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving response seen with a spiky driving at 5 Hz, but no definite spike and slow wave complex.
HR:  56 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This EEG must be considered normal in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The single asynchronous burst seen in hyperventilation is of unclear clinical significance.  Given the pattern identified with a 5 Hz driving response, comparison with childhood EEGs may be helpful in characterizing this patient’s epilepsy.  Alternatively, additional recording with repeat photic stimulation at various frequencies and/or accentuated by hyperventilation could be helpful.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is a fair amount of muscle in the background.  Features of drowsiness include rhythmic background slowing.  Hyperventilation produces intermittent bursts of theta activity, particularly from the temporal regions.  On one occasion this appears to be slightly asymmetric, but unfortunately there is movement seen in the background.  Photic stimulation is performed early on in the record and produces a driving response without clear asymmetry.
HR:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is a single somewhat asymmetric burst and there is a fair amount of movement artifact.  If appropriate, a follow-up study capturing deeper stages of sleep or with more extended monitoring may be helpful to capture epileptiform activity.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a symmetric, reactive 10 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The major abnormality in this record is occipitally predominant rhythmic approximately 5 Hz activity.  This can be seen in wakefulness and is clearly accentuated in hyperventilation.  On some occasions it is seen into stage II sleep.  This activity can be reviewed in both circle montage and a referential montage.  In hyperventilation, this activity appears to be sometimes maximum on the right spreading to the left, but in other settings, the activity appears to be symmetric, nearly identical or clearly identical at O1 and O2.  During hyperventilation, the occipitally predominant theta frequency activity has some paroxysmal build up, but does not evolve.  Other features of hyperventilation include both eye blink and hypersynchronous rhythmic high amplitude delta.
Features of stage II sleep include vertex waves and spindles.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  Some of the occipitally predominant bursts can be seen even in photic.
HR:  82 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Occipitally predominant, 5 to 6 Hz theta activity, increasing in hyperventilation and persisting into stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: To further localize this activity, a follow-up study with special electrodes may be valuable.  Correlation with neuroimaging may be helpful.  These findings were not seen on this patient’s previous EEG.

TECHNIQUE:





A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, no
sleep spindles and K-complexes seen. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) causes driving

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In wakefulness, there is frequent eye blink, but in the transition from wakefulness to drowsiness, there is also notched, sharply contoured, frontally predominant 5 to 7 Hz activity in the frontal regions, as well as a signal left mid-to-anterior temporal sharp wave.  There were a total of four left anterior temporal sharp waves.  Features of sleep include an increase in beta activity as well as occasional vertex waves and spindles.  There are multiple brief arousals from sleep.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and appears to accentuate some of the rhythmic frontal 5 to 7 Hz activity.  In sleep, there is a second, left temporal sharp wave.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage I sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 8.5 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In the transition to drowsiness, there is some slightly irregular temporal bursts seen with some shifting asymmetries left and right.  On one or two occasions, there is a T1 phase reversal.  Other features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing.  Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved. Of note, there is some electrode artifact picked up in the T2 electrode in drowsiness.
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces some background slowing as well as a single burst of sharply contoured left temporal delta activity. Photic stimulation elicits symmetric driving.
HR:  __ BPM. Check tech sheet
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Irregular, shifting temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is a clear burst of sharply contoured delta activity from the left temporal region and some suspicious sharp activity in drowsiness.  Some of this resembles wicket and with a combination of the electrode artifact and the wicket, no definitive conclusions regarding clearly epileptiform activity can be made.  In comparison to a previous EEG in April 2004, the previous EEG was normal.  A repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep would be helpful to more clearly evaluate this individual for seizures.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded in stage I and stage II sleep.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  A subtle asymmetry is noted between the 2 hemispheres with a bit of 7 Hz theta noted in the right hemisphere relative to the left and very subtle disruption of the alpha rhythm on the right.  As the patient becomes drowsy, the record becomes increasingly synchronous and symmetric.  Other features of drowsiness include rhythmic background theta and attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  Brief spindles were noted with POSTS in stage 2 sleep.  Photic stimulation was performed as the patient is drifting in to stage 2 sleep, and did not significantly activate the record.  Hyperventilation produced a vigorous hyperventilation response with an increase in rhythmic theta as well as an increase in beta.  There is some subtle, asymmetric bursts noted in hyperventilation with higher amplitude rhythmic theta noted on the left.  There is one, suspicious underlying sharp waves noted at the close of hyperventilation in the right centrotemporal region.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric and reactive, with a fairly organized mixture of alpha, beta, and
theta frequencies, with fragments of a symmetric and reactive posterior dominant rhythm that
approaches 8 Hertz. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present
but suboptimal.




Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.

There is occasional left frontal polymorphic slowing.



There are frequent spikey waveforms over F7, F8 that appear most consistent with lateral rectus spikes.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization


2. Occasional left frontal polymorphic slowing

3. Tachycardia


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of the presence of left frontal dysfunction
superimposed on a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


Tachycardia is noted on a single EKG lead.



A call was placed to this patient's long term care facility to notify them of the tachycardia.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20  system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. TI1is is an awake and drowsy record .

DESCRIPTION OF THE  RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9 Hz, 40 to 60 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  In wakefulness, early drowsiness, and hyperventilation,  there is intermittent  rhythmic left mid-temporal theta activity of 3 to 5 Hz, somewhat sharply contoured. In addition, there is occasional, somewhat more arrhythmic delta activity seen with rare left anterior temporal sharp waves. Hyperventilation and drowsiness both augment the focal slowing seen from the left temporal region. Stage I sleep is characterized by vertex waves followed by arousals.

Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving. The rhythmic left temporal theta was seen during hyperventilation, but was not clearly augmented by it.

INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG is performed in the laboratory using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of electrocardiogram. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	In wakefulness, the background EEG is
well-organized with 10 Hertz, 50 to 70 microvolts of posterior dominant rhythm. In wakefulness, particularly in the early portions of the record, there is rhythmic temporal mixed theta and delta. This is identified from the left temporal region and occurs in brief bursts. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record and accentuates this activity as well as producing some bilateral slowing. Features of drowsiness in the initial section of the record include more of the left temporal rhythmic theta/delta followed by occasional vertex
waves. Photic stimulation does not elicit a driving response.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a well-formed, 9 Hz, 30 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  In occasional drowsiness there is rhythmic, 3 to 5 Hz activity from the left mid-to-anterior temporal regions. While there is some artifact, there is a subtle sharp wave seen on rare occasions in this region.
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces a small amount of rhythmic slowing followed by attenuation of the alpha rhythm in drowsiness. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving and photoelectric effect.
Brief stage II sleep is characterized by vertex waves and spindles.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Rhythmic left frontotemporal theta activity with suspicious associated sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  This EEG differs from the previous studies in that the activity is unilateral in this record and more rhythmic in nature.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is organized with a 10 Hz, 20 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.
The major abnormality in this record is intermittent rhythmic temporal delta (FIRDA) seen in quiet wakefulness, accentuated by hyperventilation, and prominent in the transition to sleep.  It is sometimes associated with left anterior temporal spike and slow wave or sharp and slow wave complexes.  On one occasion, fast activity is associated with this.  Photic stimulation elicits both an arousal response and some driving.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is a sleep deprived EEG with a goal of recording 20 minutes of sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for a child of this age with an 8.5 to 9 Hz, 50 to 70 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In wakefulness, there are occasional LAMBDA waves.  Features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha rhythm followed by vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS in stage II sleep.  In the initial sleep recording, there are occasional left or right centrotemporal sharp waves.  As the sleep recording continues, the epileptiform activity is seen less frequently and the field may include central parietal rather than centrotemporal regions.  They are seen more frequently in the initial sleep recording than infrequently in the later sleep recording.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort producing hypersynchronous, rhythmic high amplitude slowing.
Photic stimulation is performed while the child is asleep; in fact, it is performed as the child starts to enter stage III sleep and produces a bit of driving at faster frequency activity although the child does not remain awake.

Photic stimulation is performed early on in the record.  A brief driving response is seen, but as the patient relaxes a little bit further, subtle left temporal slowing is seen.  Hyperventilation is performed subsequently and the subtle focal features can be identified.  A seizure occurred following hyperventilation and post-hyperventilation.  Post-hyperventilation, the focal slowing gradually increases 20 seconds after the onset of hyperventilation.  The seizure onset is at 14:08:37 with no clinical signs, but high amplitude spike and slow wave activity with rhythmic delta and then high amplitude delta and sharply contoured delta with a clear phase reversal at T1.  The patient starts to arouse at 14:08:57, opening his eyes and then stiffening.  He is slightly tremulous and demonstrates chewing movements.  The activity makes the transition to repetitive alpha frequency activity and then 5 Hz frequency activity by 14:09:17.  The activity begins to slow and ends at 14:09:38 for an approximate one-minute seizure duration.  The background EEG demonstrates postictal slowing in the minutes that follow, which gradually resolves.  The patient is unable to speak during the seizure and in the postictal period he nods his head from side to side.  He has a relatively lengthy postictal period including almost all the way to the end of the record.  Over time, he becomes increasingly able to speak, although initially he answers all questions with “uhm-uhm” noise.  Over time, he can answer questions, but has difficulty performing simple tasks.
HR:  94 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:

DESCRIPTION  OF   THE   RECORD:  In  wakefulness,   the  background   EEG  is symmetric  and fairly  well  organized  for  his age.   There  is  a 9  Hz,  30  uV  posterior dominant alpha rhythm, which is attenuated of low  voltage, frontocentral  beta  activity.   As the tracing continues, spike and sharp waves,  with and without slow activity, is seen at the F7 and T1 regions.   These  focal discharges  increased with hyperventilation  and also were seen in post-hyperventilation. They were occasionally  seen in photic stimulation.   Sleep  is evidenced by slow  rolling eye movements,  a mixed frequency of brain activity, vertex waves, spindles, and K complexes.   Photic stimulation elicits driving.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Central MU rhythm is identified, but testing is not performed to confirm this.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing a small amount of theta.   This is followed by sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  In the transition to sleep, there is some very subtle asymmetries in the anteriotemporal region on the left.  In stage II sleep, there are rare, left temporal subtle sharp waves.  In addition, in one section of the stage II sleep record, there is somewhat more sustained mixed theta and delta lasting approximately seven seconds.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized for a child of this age.  There is a 9.5 Hz, 70 to 80 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a fair amount of theta.   There is intermittent rhythmic left posterior temporal spike and sharp waves with occasional generalized bursts of spike wave activity lasting two to three seconds.  Hyperventilation and post-hyperventilation seems to accentuate the discharges, which are followed by brief slowing for several seconds thereafter.  The left posterior temporal discharges are localized at T5, and occasional sharp waves are also noted on the right parietal area at P4 without causing generalized spread. The generalized discharges are frontally predominant and seem to arise out of a left temporal focus maximum at T5.  Photic stimulation elicits discrete driving.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is asleep.   The background EEG is symmetric, continuous, with an excessive amount of diffuse beta activity.   When the patient is awakened, a 7 to 8 Hz, 30 V posterior dominant alpha rhythm is seen.   Superimposed on the background is excessive theta and delta slow activity seen more in the central and posterior regions.  As the tracing continues, spindles are also seen mainly in the central area symmetrically.  Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG in this excessively sleepy patient due to:
Background slowing.
Slow alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The above findings are non-specific and may suggest a mild cervical dysfunction mainly involving the gray matter.  It can be seen in patients who are excessively sleepy, in a postictal phase, or due to medications.  Clinical correlation is recommended, however, no focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record. If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG when the patient is more alert and with routine activation procedures may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record. This is the third EEG for this individual.  The two previous EEGs indicated that he had febrile convulsions.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for a child of this age with an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  In sleep, vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles are identified.
The major abnormality in this record, is discrete bursts of frontally predominant 3 Hz spike and wave activity seen in the transition to and from stage II sleep.  These are high amplitude discharges, typically occurring in discrete pairs, frontally predominant, symmetric, ranging from 3 to 3.5 Hz.  They can overlap with a spindle, which is a normal morphology of stage II sleep.  On one occasion, a pair of spike and wave complexes may be associated with an arousal.  At the close of the record, the child is stimulated from sleep, and occipitally predominant rhythmic slowing is followed by an awake pattern with LAMBDA when the child is more fully awake.
HR:  120 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	The appearance of frontally predominant, high amplitude spike and wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This activity was not seen in the two previous EEGs.  Correlation with this patient’s history may be helpful in that there were two previous EEGs demonstrating febrile convulsions with a child who may have developed afebrile convulsions and an EEG pattern that is most consistent with an inherited epilepsy.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKGand photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:




A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz, symmetric, reactive posterior dominant rhythm of 30 to 50 uV. There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. There is some eye movement artifact picked up in the temporal regions as well as some EKG artifact. Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, producing an increase in theta in the background. Following HV, as the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in background beta and some rhythmic central theta. In drowsiness, there is also some rare, rhythmic 4 to 5 Hz activity from the left temporal region. This is seen on a single location with brief bursts lasting less than a second. Photic stimulation elicits both vigorous driving and some photoelectric artifact. On two occasions, in photic stimulation with a 17 Hz stimulation and following the 15 Hz stimulation, there seems to be some rhythmic focal slowing with a mixture of theta and delta identified from the left hemisphere.
HR: 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Bursts of somewhat irregular slowing identified following photic stimulation from the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Although there are a handful of other features including a brief burst of theta from the left, which may be a normal variant, the more remarkable slowing seen in photic stimulation raises the possibility of either a structural or functional abnormality on the left. In this individual with a childhood history of generalized spike and slow wave activity, this finding has not been seen in either of her two adult EEGs. Individuals with childhood epilepsy may haw focal features in adulthood, but those described here are unusual for that.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, background EEG included the 9.5 posterior dominant rhythm a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. There is a small amount of background theta. In relaxed wakefulness, there are a handful of subtle sharp waves from the left or right temporal region. Most of them are small and discreet, but some have a more of a broader morphology, although they are never high in amplitude. They lack the simplicity of benign epileptiform transience of sleep. The patient has stimulated for hyperventilation and these morphologies disappear. Hyperventilation is performed with good effort producing an increase in background theta. There is a suggestion that it may also accentuate an arrhythmic delta from the left with independent right and left temporal sharp and slow wave, or spike and slow wave complexes. The epileptiform activity identified in hyperventilation was denoted on the record. Towards the close of the record, high amplitude right inter temple spike and slow wave complexes with generous field of spread were observed. As the patient becomes drowsy, the right temporal sharp waves are again well defined and the left temporal features are not as commonly identified. Other features of sleep include vertex waves and posts. Photic stimulation elicits harmonic with supra harmonic striving.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right anterior temple spike and slow wave complexes accentuated by hyperventilation and seen in the transition from wakefulness into drowsiness.
2. Occasional more poorly defined left temporal sharp waves.
Clinical correlation: For this young adult with a strong family history of epilepsy, this study today is most supportive of a localization related mechanism with a right inter temple sharp wave with a generous field of spread. There is a remarkably bigger striving response, but not a clearly pathological one.
Additional review of the epilepsy in the family would be important to know if this individual's epilepsy is similar or just similar to other members in the kindred. In contrast to previous studies, the vast majority of epileptiform features today were on the right rather than the left.

Wicket activity is identified from the temporal regions bilaterally. Discrete right temporal sharp waves are noted at T2. They are so discrete in nature and occur out of the wicket that they almost look like an artifact; however, there is clearly an after-going slow wave and there is disruption of the background. They are also nearly the amplitude of the EKG artifact but clearly can be differentiated from the EKG as fortunately they do not occur in conjunction with the EKG. These appear in relaxed wakefulness as the patient start to drift off toward sleep. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous bilateral driving response.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and is associated with chewing and other artifacts, however, the patient doesn't  seem to be doing much to produce artifacts. Following hyperventilation,  the patient becomes drowsy.   Vertex waves and abundant beta activity is identified in sleep.  Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is still relatively drowsy and elicits brief driving.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system
of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photo stimulation are
performed. As the tracing begins, the patient is described as very emotional.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial portions of the record, the background
EEG is somewhat disorganized, however, over time there are portions where the EEG
is better organized and the alpha rhythm improved from 8 Hertz to 10 Hertz. In
wakefulness, there is occasional shift in arrhythmic delta activity. In addition, there is
subtle asymmetry with perhaps a bit more slowing from the right than the left. Photic
stimulation is performed while the patient is awake and does not significantly activate
the record. Photo stimulation does increase some of the background slowing.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Shifting arrhythmic delta activity a bit more prominent in the right hemisphere
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports an underlying disturbance of cerebral
function likely involving white matter. No definitive epileptiform features were observed
today.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video BEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is initially asleep and is poorly cooperative.
DESCRIPTION OF THE  RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is moving around quite a bit.  In the initial portion of the BEG, underneath the movement artifact, there is a low voltage fast pattern without the typical morphologies of an adult.  As he becomes more cooperative, there is a pattern of slow rolling eye movements with a theta background, a few POSTS, and a bit more theta from the left compared to the right. Sleep is characterized by vertex waves and beta spindles.
HR: 78BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal BEG for an adult of this age due to:
1.  Absence of the normal awake adult developmental milestones.
2.  BEG in sleep demonstrates some asymmetries of the theta in the transition to sleep.

in drowsiness, there is intermittent delta from the left temporal region with delta ranging from 50-100 uV, at times sharply contoured. When the patient awakens however, the delta essentially
disappears however, features of drowsiness with slow eye movements are remarkable for the
subtly emergence of the same focal delta. Lateral wicket activity is identified from both temporal
regions. Stage I sleep is identified from both temporal regions. Stage I sleep is characterized by
vertex waves and spindles. As the sleep record continues, there is some subtle asymmetry in
terms of the amplitude of the sleep record and as the patient emerges from sleep again, the left
temporal delta is identified. Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.

SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.	The waking background is low voltage with frequent eye flutter
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
There are normal sleep transients, with synchronous sleep
spindles and rare K-complexes present during Stage II sleep. Slow wave sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces mild diffuse symmetric background increase in amplitude as well as symmetric frontal theta/delta.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal Awake and asleep routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: ·
This is a normal, low voltage Awake and asleep routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
This EEG contrasts to prior EEGS which demonstrated focal and /or generalized features:
2010: Background slowing

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the OR using standard CEA montage with one channel of EKG. The recording begins at 8:20 AM and concludes at 12:17 PM.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is in the OR.  He may have been sedated, but induction has not occurred.  There is a 7 to 8 Hz background at 8:24:39 and an anesthetic pattern with the appearance of rhythmic frontal delta and some triangular-shaped waves in the posterior region.  Following the induction of anesthesia, the EEG is slightly discontinuous, but there is no significant focality.  The discontinuity waxes and wanes and is at times subtle.  Heparin is given at 10:15, and the initial clamp is placed at 11:01.  The EEG becomes somewhat discontinuous at 11:02.  These findings are communicated to the surgeon who requests a shunt.  In the discontinuous pattern, there is also a bit of shifting asymmetry.  In addition, there is some slowing identified out of the left prior to placement of the shunt.  The shunt is opened at 11:05.  In addition, as the shunt is placed, there seems to have been a change in the level of anesthesia and in this low voltage pattern, there is more faster frequency activity.  The EEG returns to baseline by 11:06.  The clamp is removed and reclamped at 11:55, 12:01.  Patency is confirmed by doppler at 12:02.  Throughout the procedure, with the clamping  and unclamping, there is some waxing and waning with at times a bit more slowing on the left or the right and also some subtle discontinuity.
By the close of the recording at 12:17, there is some shifting asymmetries, with some head-rocking movements but a question of a bit more slowing in the left posterior quadrant.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: EEG monitoring during this carotid endarterectomy was remarkable for:
An abnormal baseline with shifting asymmetries.
Transient focal slowing from the left and discontinuity with placement of the clamp; alleviated by shunt.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. The patient’s previous EEGs were not available at this time.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is intermittent rhythmic theta from the left hemisphere.  Although there is a breach rhythm, and there is some muscle artifact, there appears to be an underlying spike and slow wave complex identified from the left mid-temporal region, accentuated by hyperventilation.  Following hyperventilation, the patient becomes drowsy and in drowsiness there are vertex waves and POSTS.  The amplitude is somewhat higher from the left than the right, accentuating the POSTS on the left.  As the patient reaches sleep, in this sharply contoured background, there is both accentuation of beta on the left but there are a handful of sharp waves that also come out of this background.  Snore artifact is also identified in stage II sleep.
Photic stimulation elicits a driving response, which is markedly accentuated on the left.
HR:  54 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Left temporal theta accentuated by drowsiness and hyperventilation.
Left temporal sharp waves in hyperventilation and in stage II sleep.  The morphology is compatible with a breach rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The prominent breach rhythm accentuates the beta activity in stage II sleep and produces an increase in the amplitude of the background in photic stimulation, but is simply a manifestation of the previous craniotomy.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Much of the record includes a drowsy state with
generous beta. A breach rhythm is identified in the left frontocentral region. In addition, occasional left temporal rhythmic focal slowing and sharp waves are noted in both wakefulness, hyperventilation, and drowsiness. These are discrete and can be
differentiated from the patient's EKG artifact. Scant wakefulness includes a symmetric reactive posterior dominate rhythm.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left temporal focal slowing.
2. Left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is the patient's 4th EEG. The 2006 study
demonstrated both focal slowing and sharp waves, although the follow-up EEGs
demonstrated only focal slowing, focal delta. The individual remains seizure free, but
these findings support a localized mechanism for epilepsy.

TECHNIQUE:

A one hour Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is low voltage, symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a
moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 12 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR),
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. There is prominent diffuse beta.




During drowsiness, there is slowing of the PDR followed by slow rolling eye movements, attenuation
and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
There was generous beta.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
POSTs, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured. There is generous beta
noted in drowsiness.




No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None

Wicket is seen.





ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: produces an increase in amplitude in the background.



Photic Stimulation: a driving response is seen although the patient was falling asleep during photic
stimulation.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy. There is generous beta
noted in this record. This is also a low voltage pattern. These findings can be seen in normal adults.


This individual has 6 prior EEGs. Four were available for review. Three, 2010, 2008, 2007

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing an increase in rhythmic slowing.  Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is becoming drowsy.  There is no clear photic driving response.  Following photic stimulation, stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles is noted.  Multiple spontaneous arousals from sleep are observed.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient is poorly responsive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow, a theta pattern. With stimulation, there is an increase in faster frequency activity. There is an area of sharply contoured slowing in the right posterior temporal region. Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting response, but when stimulation ends, the patient drifts off to sleep with vertex waves and spindles. These focal features in the right posterior quadrant are not as remarkable in sleep.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long term monitoring, 6 hours EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  Wakefulness and sleep were recorded.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  After 10:00 at night until 6:00 in the morning from November 6 to November 7, 2011 there was marked muscle and multielectrode artifact to almost impossible reading the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record at the beginning opens to a diffusely slow low amplitude recording with no clear posterior dominant rhythm.  By 2 hours into the recording faster frequencies can be seen and improvement of the EEG to baseline was seen.  At best the posterior dominant rhythm reaches 8 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of frontal central beta seen.  Some sleep architecture is seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Occasional bursts of polyspike and generalized spike and waves seen at 4.5 to 5 Hz with anterior predominance  symmetrically over both hemispheres.  None of the bursts last more than 1 second.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness background EEG is well
organized. There is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm of 30 microvolts
with small amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity. Lambda
waves are observed in wakefulness. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous
bilateral driving. Features of drowsiness slow rolling eye movements
and an attenuation of the alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation does not
significantly activate the rhythm. In photic stimulation there is
vigorous driving. The patient appears to be awake during photic
stimulation with eye movement, but there also seems to be a vertex
sharp wave, sometimes seen prior to or following the photic
stimulation. Additional testing is not performed upon the photic
stimulation to make sure that the patient is not becoming drowsy. He
has eye movements to suggest that he is awake, and once the photic has
concluded this vertex sharp wave is not observed at another time.

TECHNIQUE:





A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9-10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. At times there
is a slow alpha variant seen at 4-5 Hz.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured. Rare POSTs are seen.



No generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Rare (<1hour) there are rare left temporal and right temporal independent sharp waves. The right
sharps are maximal at T4 and the left sharps at T3.

Sharpy contoured activity of unknown significance is also seen.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.

and right basal ganglia with associated mass effect as above.. Encephalomalacia/gliosis in the left
anterior temporal and left frontal lobes with chronic blood products likely related to remote trauma.
Small focus of chronic hemorrhage in the left basal ganglia.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is actively abnormal and asymmetric.  It is characterized in asymmetry.  The
left hemisphere is slightly disorganized but with the posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz 30 uV.  There
is excess theta, intermittent arrhythmic delta activity and greater variability than anticipated in
wakefulness on the left.  The right hemisphere is characterized by significant disruption of the
posterior dominant rhythm, disruption of faster frequency activity and bursts of relatively rhythmic 1-3
Hz delta activity maximum in the frontal regions, sometimes occurring in bursts lasting 3-5 seconds



Generalized slowing is present.


Focal slowing is present.

Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in rhythmic frontal delta bilaterally

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

The bursts of prominent, paroxysmal frontal delta are in the region of this patient's hemorrhage.
Because of the prominent paroxysmal quality, additional monitoring may be of value.

This EEG supports a structural abnormality in the right hemisphere, superimposed upon a
bihemispheric process, congruent with the findings outlined by imaging.  No seizures were recorded.

Occasional arrhythmic delta activity is observed more so in the right hemisphere than the left . Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing, followed by spontaneous arousals.
HR:	90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent arrhythmic delta activity observed from the right hemisphere .
Occasional shifting arrhythmic delta activity in a transition from sleep in either hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   No epileptiform features were observed. This EEG supports a structural or functional abnormality on the right. There is trivial, shifting arrhythmic delta activity, but a bit more prominent than one would anticipate for a subject of this age. Correlation with imaging and clinical history may be beneficial.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, and others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is described as responsive to stimuli.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is somewhat arousable.  The overall background is rich in beta frequency activity, particularly in the frontal regions.  The patient is wearing a hard collar with multiple apparatus on the face, neck, and scalp.  Spontaneous arousals are associated with more of a pattern of diffuse beta.  Head-rocking artifact is picked up in the posterior scalp electrodes.  Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting response with an increase in beta and theta.  There are rare asymmetries with a bit higher amplitude rhythmic theta in the right or frontal regions.
HR:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background primarily with a pattern rich in beta frequency activity, but with smaller amounts of theta and alpha frequency activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The reactivity and variability are positive prognostic features.  Medications that produce beta may account for the pattern described above in this individual who is responsive to external stimuli.  There are no epileptiform features identified in this record, and the focal frontal features are subtle.

Description:
The background consists of low voltage 10-11 Hz alpha posteriorly with expected AP gradient.
Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  Symmetrical K-complexes are captured.
Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the  right midtemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Additionally, faster frequencies at higher amplitudes are

captured.  During sleep they increase in frequency and become frequent.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively low voltage.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, producing an increase in the amplitude of the background.  At that time, a low voltage 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm is identified bilaterally.  Despite movement artifact, there is a glimpse of a left mid-to-anterior temporal region in HV.  This is followed by a drowsy pattern at which point there is some subtle focal slowing discernable in the left anteriotemporal region.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, he begins to snore, again producing a fair amount of artifact.  Other features of sleep include some vertex activity.   In sleep, well-defined left anteriotemporal spike and slow wave complexes are identified.  The patient remains asleep during photic stimulation, with features of stage II sleep and spindles, but no clear driving.  In this sleep state, during HV, the left anteriotemporal spike and slow wave complexes are better defined and then the patient briefly awakens towards the end of HV.

Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well formed and modulated 9 Hz alpha activity that
attenuates with eye opening.  PDR is better formed and modulated over the left.  There is an
anterior-to-posterior frequency-amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes
anteriorly.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely,
followed by symmetric vertex waves.
There is continuous interhemispheric voltage asymmetry with lower voltages over the right.
Additionally, there is paucity of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere, especially over the
anterior and median quadrants.  Semi-rhythmic sharply contoured delta activity at 1-1.25 Hz is
observed over the right frontotemporal region during and following hyperventilation.  Occasional
right frontotemporal sharp waves are noted.  Maximal scalp negativity occurs over F8, T2, Fp2 and
F4 electrodes.  These discharges become more apparent during photic stimulation.  No clear
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) produces semi-rhythmic sharply
contoured right frontotemporal delta activity and accentuates right frontotemporal sharp waves.

This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 24-minute EEG due to mild-to-moderate right
hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the anterior and middle quadrants and occasional
right frontotemporal epileptiform discharges. Focal slowing and voltage attenuation over the right
is suggestive of focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology.  A potential epileptogenic

seizures.  Please correlate clinically electrographic seizures are captured.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, and Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  The patient is very sleepy throughout the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background theta.  The patient has some eye movement artifact in stage I sleep, some of which is picked up in the temporal regions, but there is no definite epileptiform activity seen.  As the patient reaches deeper stages of sleep with vertex waves, no epileptiform activity is identified.  Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting into stage I and II sleep, and does not activate the record.
HR:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Eye movements into sleep are of unclear clinical significance.  If further information is needed to characterize this patient’s seizures, additional EEG recording may be valuable.

The patient demonstrated toxic Dilantin levels.
MEDICATION:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient had experienced a seizure 40 minutes prior to the EEG and was quite confused.  This is a technically satisfactory record aside from slightly increased impedance in the T1 and T2 electrodes.  Digital video EEG is performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is initially postictal and confused.  She has a little difficulty cooperating with the test and some head rocking movements.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The initial sections of the record demonstrate a low voltage, slow record with some head rocking artifact.  A posterior dominant rhythm of 6.5 Hz was noted.  Hyperventilation was attempted.  This served to alert the patient.  Following this, the patient drift off to sleep with low voltage vertex waves.  Occasional snore artifact was noted.
Heart rate:  72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are identified.  The background slowing is an anticipated finding for an acutely postictal patient.  No epileptiform features were seen in this EEG or in this patient's 2 previous EEGs earlier this year.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10.5 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is some single electrode artifact picked up in the right frontotemporal electrodes, but there is an abnormality identified in this EEG identifiable after the electrodes are attended to. This includes rhythmic focal slowing from the right temporal regions, which is at times sustained and sharply contoured at the end of HV and early drowsiness.  In addition, using bipolar and average reference electrodes, there are two pairs of subtle frontotemporal sharp waves.  One has generous representation at Fp2, F4, and T4, as well as F8 and T4.  The other is clearly F8 and T4.  Other features of drowsiness include vertex waves and an increase in background beta.  Photic stimulation is remarkable for eliciting an alerting response and some driving bilaterally.  The patient is drifting in and out of stage II sleep in photic stimulation.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Ativan, Etomidate, Fentanyl, Versed, ROCURONIUM
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is starting to emerge from paralysis and demonstrates stiffening and movements.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is a bit quieter. Activity demonstrates a slow pattern with some rhythmic mixed theta and delta on the left with a lower voltage, slower, a bit more suppressed pattern on the right, particularly in the temporal regions.
Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting with an increase in muscle as well as alpha and theta frequency activity. During the EEG, the patient starts to wake up, move around, and cough. After this, there is a more alert pattern with more theta frequency and alpha frequency activity from the left, but the right remains quite slow. By the end of the record in this very sharply contoured record, there was a suggestion of underlying sharp activity versus part of the fast activity at F3. In addition, more sharply contoured slowing is seen at T4-T6.
HR: 84 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Nearly continuous focal slowing on the right hemisphere.
2. Occasional T4-T6 sharps and question F3 sharps as well.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe, bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function as would be expected following the use of sedative, hypnotic medications. The focal slowing and rare sharp waves on the right are compatible with past right temporal hemorrhage. Additional evaluation of this patient's cerebral function may be needed. Ongoing EEG monitoring was undertaken to make sure no additional seizures occurred.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is poorly responsive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10Hz alpha rhythm identified on the left. Faster frequency activity is attenuated on the right. The patient is conversant with the tech. This patient has an event during the EEG. The event occurs at 10:08 a.m. It is characterized by staring, jerking of the head from side to side. The EEG is remarkable for some sharp waves and some motion artifacts. The sharp waves are seen in the right frontocentral region. There is significant muscle activity. The patient is conversant during the spell. No postictal slowing is noted. Photic stimulation elicits a brief driving response on the left.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the right.
2. An event during the EEG without impairment of awareness. Although there is some artifact, there are some discharges in the same region as the patient's sharp waves. While the event might not be considered a simple partial or a complex partial seizure, the motor activity observed may be linked to the epileptiform activity elicited from the right frontocentral region which could have produced the features described above.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient has an event during the EEG. Hyperventilation is performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Although the patient is markedly drowsy throughout much of the record, there is a 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta and theta.  Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort, producing an increase in the amplitude of the background.  At the end of hyperventilation, the patient has a single episode of both shoulders jerking at 11:37:07.  Slowly, at 11:53, she starts to have rocking of the head from side to side and then has rocking from side to side with alternating movements of the hands, with hands coming up and going down and then head rocking from side to side.  During this event, although there is some movement artifact, the EEG otherwise demonstrates an awake pattern.  The technologist interacts with the patient during the event giving her a code word.  The patient has multiple different behaviors during this episode including brief hyperextension of the back and then slow rocking from side to side.
Towards the end of the behavior, the tech uses a nasal tickle.  The patient looks apprehensive and at one point turns away just briefly, but doesn’t move substantially.  She does blink to threat during the event, and towards the end of the event, seems upset or angry and is staring away from the direction of the technologist.  As the technologist moves around the room, however, the patient can be seen to track the tech with her eyes.  After the event is over, the patient tells the tech that the only thing she can remember is that her name is [patient’s name].
HR:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Although the patient was initially quite drowsy, there is no epileptiform activity.  This patient had a complex and prolonged behavioral event without EEG change.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  In wakefulness and in hyperventilation, there is subtle underlying slowing with initially some arrhythmic delta activity seen from the right hemisphere, sometimes with disruption of the alpha rhythm. As HV continues, some shifting slowing is seen.  Features of drowsiness include a decrease in eye movements.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was performed.   This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well enough organized for age with a posterior dominant rhythm averaging 6 Hz, sometimes somewhat faster, reaching amplitudes up to 100 uV.  Features of drowsiness include hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing.  Vertex waves are identified with brief sleep epochs and then spontaneous arousals. Hyperventilation produces rhythmic slowing.
Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Although there are multiple episodes of hypersynchronous rhythmic 5 Hz activity, the static can be re-reviewed and is without epileptiform activity and is simply characteristic of a prominent hypnagogic hypersynchrony.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  This is this child’s third EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 6.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive.  There are portions of the record when the child is awake when the background is appropriately organized for age.
The major abnormalities in this record include complex epileptiform activity, which can be best viewed at fast paper speed of six seconds per page and/or average reference.  These include spike and slow wave complexes, which are high in amplitude and sometimes seem almost electropositive in the mid-temporal region, but in most of the montages are maximum at C3.  They are variable with some having a much more generous field of spread to the frontocentral region or left hemisphere and others more restricted.  They are picked up by volume conduction in the contralateral hemisphere.  In addition, there are some generalized frontally predominant spike and slow wave discharges, some of which are 3.5 to 4 Hz, but which are slightly irregular.  As the child drifts off to sleep, marked background slowing is observed and prominent, high amplitude slow spike and wave complexes are identified.  These are picked up in the frontocentral region, but more so on the left.
As the child drifts off to sleep, he is lying on his side, away from the camera and towards his mother.  Initially, he seems to have jerking forward of the head.  Subsequently, he seems almost to be having a salaam-like seizure as he drifts off to sleep, jerking towards his mother with his arms coming up a little bit.  This seems to elicit an arousal from sleep.  The epileptiform activity is high in amplitude, but some sections of the sleep record seem to demonstrate a sleep pattern that is remarkable for prominent attenuation of the typical morphologies in sleep with this high amplitude spike and slow wave pathology, most prominent in the frontal regions and again with an unusual field but with more of a predominance to the left hemisphere.  The child does fall off to sleep at 12:51.
HR:  114 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Prominent epileptiform activity with complex epileptiform activity, slow spike and wave activity, and focal spike and slow wave activity, but activity that on the whole raises concerns about a process involving the left hemisphere.
Concerns that the background activity in sleep is slower than expected particularly in the frontocentral regions, left greater than right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings must be correlated with imaging and clinical exam at this juncture.  They differ from the two previous EEGs, which were not successful in identifying epileptiform activity.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is awake.  There is a 9 to 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a fair amount of eye artifact.   Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and does elicit some left anteriotemporal sharp and slow wave complexes in association with hyperventilation. Following hyperventilation, the patient becomes somewhat drowsy and there is a small amount of slowing in the left mid-temporal region in this somewhat drowsy pattern.  There is also a high amplitude left anteriotemporal spike and slow wave complex.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is a left anteriotemporal spike component, but this has a bifrontal field.  This activity can be reviewed with other montages where again it seems to be primarily left temporal with some spread into the eye movement channel.  It is prominent with almost a focal spike and wave component as the patient becomes drowsy and reaches stage II sleep.  Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is in stage II sleep and does not significantly activate the record.  The record ends at 13:45 and the seizure is not captured on the video or the EEG.
HR:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for this individual due to:
Focal, high amplitude spike and slow wave activity identified from the left anteriotemporal region with almost a focal spike and wave component.

TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




Diffuse excess beta activity is present.



During brief drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:




There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  Rare premature QRS complexes are seen.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and briefly drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic

They are not associated with loss of consciousness.

MEDICATIONS:

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There is limited maximal wakefulness with a well-defined alpha rhythm.  The alpha frequency is 12 Hz, 30 to 50 uV and is slightly higher amplitude on the left compared to the right.  Much of the record includes drowsiness or sleep with slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  In the transition to sleep, there is a drowsy pattern with rhythmic theta, which is identified bilaterally and is symmetric.  There is a slight amplitude asymmetry on some occasions as slowing develops in the record, with again slightly higher amplitude slowing from the left compared to the right.  Vertex waves in stage I sleep are symmetric.  POSTS are identified bilaterally.

Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, producing an increase in background beta.  Notably, at baseline, the patient’s heart rate is 72 BPM and irregular.  In hyperventilation, the heart rate becomes more irregular, increasing to 96 BPM and is associated with the feeling of light-headedness and a twitchy feeling.  The twitchy feeling is identified at 13:51.  No epileptiform features are identified at that time, although there is an increase in background beta.

Photic stimulation elicits a driving response bilaterally.  The driving response is quite vigorous, but in the slower frequency flash stimuli, it is higher amplitude and more prominent from the left compared to the right.

HR:  72 BPM, irregular.

IMPRESSION: Given the presence of an alpha asymmetry and the amplitude asymmetry, as well as the photic asymmetry, this is a mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. The amplitude asymmetry comparing the left to the right and the slightly asymmetric photic stimulation.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  In this individual with a history of childhood head trauma, these findings should be correlated with imaging.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. No clinical symptoms were reported during this EEG. The patient is known to have a right skull defect.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz, 30 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. In wakefulness, there is a small intrahemispheric asymmetry with accentuation of fast activity in the right frontocentral region compared to the left.  This is compatible with a breach rhythm.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.  During hyperventilation, the background EEG demonstrates an awake pattern with an increase in the amplitude and a small increase in theta.  Notably, in hyperventilation, the heart rate increases from 70 to 90 BPM.  The patient reports experiencing the typical symptoms of one of his events.
Photic stimulation is remarkable for a driving response.  The patient’s breach rhythm is somewhat more prominent during photic.
HR:  70 to 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In view of the breach rhythm, which is a manifestation of a previous skull defect, the amplitude asymmetries and the beta asymmetries are anticipated findings.  As was seen in a previous EEG, the patient again felt tachycardic during hyperventilation and again demonstrated an increase in heart rate.
Additional, neurocardiac monitoring may be helpful to further characterize his spells.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In apparent wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow for a child of this age with rhythmic 3 to 5 Hz activity and a posterior dominant rhythm, which is more typically on the order of 3 Hz, as well as a bit more background slowing than one would expect.  There are rare, high amplitude left frontocentral spike and slow wave complexes. Features of drowsiness include hypersynchronous slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing is a non-specific finding and can be seen in a postictal state, although the child does appear awake and quite interactive.  The left frontocentral spike and slow wave activity is rare, but is high amplitude and well defined.  Correlation with imaging and clinical history may be valuable.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a dominant rhythm averaging 7.8 to 8.5 Hz with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is small amount of excess theta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there are occasional bursts of rhythmic frontal slowing.  At times, the drowsy pattern is sharply contoured and disorganized.  Photic stimulation elicits minimal bilateral driving.
HR:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Intermittent disorganization and generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are non-specific.  In a subject of this age, this may be due to an underlying toxic or metabolic encephalopathy or postictal state.   No epileptiform features were seen.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat poorly organized.  There is an 8 to 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm in a background with excess background theta.  There is a great deal of muscle and movement artifact and, in fact, the muscle is present even into sleep.  Underlying this, there is some intermittent arrhythmic delta activity sometimes sharply contoured in the left temporal region.  Vertex waves and spindles are seen in stage II sleep, but there remains a fair amount of muscle in sleep.  Hyperventilation is performed with poor effort, but does seem to produce both generalized rhythmic frontal slowing, as well as accentuating some of the focal slowing from the left.  Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving.
HR:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing and poor organization.
Superimposed focal slowing from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record, however, given the amount of muscle artifact noted in the background, if epileptiform activity is of importance, a repeat sleep record may be necessary.  No periodic changes were seen.  In this individual who was evaluated for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, not all individuals demonstrate the characteristic pseudoperiodic findings initially and additional studies over a 12 week period may be necessary.

electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, lethargic
Description:
During very brief wakefulness the background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm,
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present
during very brief wakefulness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity,
frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes
intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and
symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Hyperventilation is not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL briefly awake and mostly asleep 23-minute portable EEG due to mild
diffuse slowing. This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific, but in this patient is at least partially secondary to excessive drowsiness.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement  with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation  was performed.   This is an awake and drowsy record. The patient is intermittently agitated and confused.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is low-to-medium amplitude with a
10 Hz alpha rhythm, generous beta activity and occasional bursts of frontal delta. Features of
drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.    A seizure emanating from the left anterior temporal   region is identified at 9:35:56 lasting 44 seconds.   The patient is noted to shift with eye blinking.  There are some automatisms and blinking associated with this.   The seizure ends abruptly with little in the way of postictal change other than more of a low voltage beta pattern.  The activity from the left temporal region is primarily theta frequency.  After the seizure ends, the patient starts to reach purposefully with his right.
The postictal recording is remarkable for occasional shifting arrhythmic delta, a bit more remarkable from the left frontal region than the right.
Photic stimulation does not activate the record. HR:  120BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1 .     A left anterior temporal focal seizure.
2.   Intermittent left temporal focal slowing.
3.   Excess beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Testing was not performed during the seizure, but it did appear to be clinically significant with some automatisms, which may have been difficult to distinguish in this confused adult.

Medications:	Keppra, sertraline Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, bitemporal theta and delta activity become prominent. This activity then progresses to diffuse bursts of of somewhat rhythmic delta activity.
No clear focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.

Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22-minute EEG, awake and drowsy. No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.

left mid temporal region.  That focal slowing is more prominent in hyperventilation than it is in the drowsy state with somewhat rhythmic mixed state in the left mid temporal region.  Features of stage 2 sleep include vertex, alpha, K complexes and spindles.
The patient is drowsy during photic stimulation.  Drifting into stage 1 sleep, but there is a
brief driving response.
HR: 	60 bpm
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 		Focal slowing observed primarily in hyperventilation but also seen intermittently in drowsiness with some rhythmic, sharply contoured slowing in the left mid temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   Focal slowing is a bit anterior to the cavernous hemangioma.  It supports structural function abnormality and can be seen in the context of an underlying seizures disorder.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the EEG demonstrates an awake pattern with an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There are intermittent bursts of 4 to 5 Hz activity identified from the right frontal region, which are high in amplitude with some volume conduction to the left, but clearly maximum on the right.  There is also intermittent rhythmic 6 to 7 Hz theta activity identified from the frontal regions.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing bursts of rhythmic, high amplitude synchronous slowing, which is sharply contoured but without definitive localization.  There are more subtle discharges identified in hyperventilation, sharply contoured, with after going slow waves, again maximum primarily in the right frontal region.
Following hyperventilation, as the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in background slowing followed by vertex waves, spindles, and POSTS.  Stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.  The patient seems to be falling asleep during photic stimulation.
HR:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Right frontal, 4 to 5 Hz spike and slow wave activity.
Intermittent, hypersynchronous rhythmic theta from the frontal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing suggests a localization-related mechanism for this patient’s epilepsy.   Correlation with imaging may be valuable.

DESCRIPTION OF THE   RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized. Unfortunately, as the record continues there are increasing amounts of muscle artifact. There is a suggestion of a low voltage, 9-
10 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral

Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Background voltages are low.  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low voltage beta activity that attenuates with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV,  18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  The majority of the background consists of low amplitude diffuse beta activity.   During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.   During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.   Frequent positive sharp waves occur bilaterally and independently in the occipital regions during drowsiness  and light sleep.
Occasional low voltage sharp waves are seen over the left fronto-temporal region (Fp1/F7/F3). A benign variant (BETS, benign epileptiform transients of sleep) cannot entirely be excluded.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates. A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate 54 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, occasional, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal 1-hour awake and asleep EEG due to: 1. Left frontotemporal sharp waves (Fp1/F7/F3). While these sharp waves are most likely epileptiform, a benign variant (BETS) cannot entirely be excluded. Of note, low voltage backgrounds are a benign variant in the adult population.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. The patient is intubated, unresponsive and examined during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates essentially continuous pattern rich in theta frequency activity. Arrhythmic delta activity is prominent in the posterior regions, right more so than the left. Some of this is sharply contoured.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG includes generally 7
Hz theta. There is a small amount of background disorganization and a posterior dominant rhythm of 7-8 Hz. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increasing amplitude of the background as well some rhythmic frontal delta and 1 or 2 bursts of sharply contoured delta. Towards the close of Hv, a very high amplitude burst of monomorphic  notched
3 Hz activity is observed. The amplitude of this activity is greater than 200 microvolts  in some
areas, approximately 150 microvolts in the frontal regions. Because of this the activity blocks but there is a spike and wave complex associated with this activity. Use of alternatives montages again suggested this is clearly a spike and wave discharge of 8 seconds duration. Although the tech described no clinical symptoms associated with this, auditory stimulation is not performed. Of note the patient does have an arousal immediately  after cessation of the discharge. Following hyperventilation, as the patient starts becoming drowsy vertex activity is observed. A second burst of generalized spike and wave activity is observed again, 8 seconds in duration. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Two 8 second bursts of frontally predominant 3 Hz generalized spike and wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The rare bursts of sharply contoured slowing in the left temporal region are of unclear clinical significance. Carbamazepine has been reported to accentuate  this form of epileptiform activity and this form of generalized epilepsy.

TECHNIQUE:








A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically suboptimal
record with excessive muscle and electrode artifact and included a single channel of EKG,
hyperventilation, and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5-9 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Excessive muscles artifact obscures
portions of the underlying cerebral electrical activity. In addition, a large amount of eye blink artifact
and electrode artifact at O2 were seen.




Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. The patient had a coughing spell while in the lab.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG is well­ organized with 9.5, Hz 50, 50-70 microvolts posterior dominant rhythm. A normal variant is observed in the background with rhythmic mid temporal, 5 Hz activity in the temporal regions, right or left. The technologist tested the patient on multiple occasions with stimulation of the patient always terminates these strains at 5 Hz flat top shaped activity, which may be unilateral or bilaterally.
At 11: 30: 54: The patient is sitting comfortably and has a heart rate of 84. She has a coughing spell, feeling as if she cannot catch her breath, and as if she is about to lose contact. The coughing spell is associated with muscle movement artifact, followed by burst of high amplitude delta. The heart rate increases to 132 beats per minute.
By 11:31:44: the EEG has returned to normal, but the patient remains tachycardic and feels unwell. Additional coughing again produces some of the same artifact, and some burst of delta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:   The rhythmic mid temporal theta described above is a normal variant, sometimes referred to as psychomotor variant. The patient had 2 episodes of coughing, with an increase in delta. The physiologic conclusion would be that prolonged coughing is the results in a hyperventilation response with the same sort of entity as would be expected to see in hyperventilation in the lab.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement  with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, background  EEG demonstrates an interhemispheric asymmetry. The left hemisphere is appropriately  organized with 9 Hz 50 mV posterior dominant rhythm. The right hemisphere  is characterized  by intermittent arrhythmic delta. Although, much of the faster frequency activity persists with periodic, right centrotemporal sharp waves with a field of spread essentially throughout the entire right hemisphere. These vary in terms of the periodicity, but do not evolve to seizures. If the patient becomes drowsy, they become lower amplitude with more a pattern of sharply contoured delta. Deeper stages of sleep are characterized  by an increase in beta frequency activity. The patient is easily
stimulated with an awake pattern from the left and a periodic sharply contoured  slowing from the
right.
HR: 	96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram:
1. 	Right-sided focal slowing.
2. 	Periodic, high-amplitude  right temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORR ELATION:
This EEG supports a structural abnormality  on the right involving
gray and white matter. The periodic sharp waves support cortical irritability. This is a highly irritative pattern that raises concerns for ongoing seizures.  These results were reviewed with clinical team on 10/12/2007.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are a number of unusual features in this record including the possibility of REM sleep in a single 1 hour record. The REM sleep appeared to be fragmented.  Another usual feature was the presence of rhythmic alpha rhythmic activity from the left central temporal region into stage 2 sleep.
This could not be considered clearly pathological  as it was sometimes present on there right. In any case, the alpha frequency activity did not wax and wane as might be anticipated in an epileptiform  pathology
Given the presence of the metal plate, epileptiform  activity may be under recognized in this individual. The previous craniotomy and skull defect in this case provide a breech rhythm with accentuation of activity, but the possibility of that activity is masked could not be excluded.

and well organized for a young adult of this age. There is a 10 Hz, 50 to 70 microvolt,
posterior dominant rhythm present bilaterally. Hyperventilation is performed early on in
the record, increasing the amplitude of the background. Hyperventilation also produces
some brief bursts of background slowing. Following hyperventilation, the patient
becomes somewhat drowsy with slower eye movements. Photic stimulation does not
activate the record.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing and increase in amplitude of the background as well as some rhythmic delta from the right hemisphere, but without disruption of the underlying faster frequency activity. As the patient becomes drowsy again, there is a subtle disruption of faster frequency activity with subtle rhythmic slowing in the right temporal region. This is seen with brief transitions into stage II sleep but deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. On one occasion, in the transition to sleep there are sharp waves with rhythmic slowing out of the right temporal region followed by an arousal period. Unfortunately, there is some wick-like activity at this same time and there are some additional more subtle sharp waves without the same faster frequency activity noted. Photic stimulation elicits a bilateral driving response. During photic stimulation, a well defined right anterotemporal spike in slow-wave complex is observed. Additional spike complexes are noted at the very end of the record, again right anterotemporal.
HR: 80 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic slowing in the right temporal region.
2. Right anterotemporal spike and slow-wave complexes and sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings support a localization related mechanism for epilepsy.

DESCRIPTION OF THE As the tracing opens, the patient is relatively lethargic, but
over the course of this postictal EEG, the patient is more arousable. The initial background is
low voltage, diffusely slow, but there are intermittent arousals with approximately 8 Hertz alpha
rhythm identified bilaterally right better than left. The patient waxes and wanes with some
portions of the records which are reasonably well organized with alpha and theta activity, other
which are low voltage featureless delta and others which are a mix of irregular mixed theta and
delta. Activity is slightly higher on the right. Through the course of the record, intermittent
attenuations are observed and there is a fair amount of waxing and waning although the close -
of the record does seem to be better then the beginning. There is some sharp slowing observed
in the right mid to anterior temporal region with an after going slow wave observed.

TECHNIQUE:

A 1 hour Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International
10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically
satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG  and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.3 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  Maximal
wakefulness on the whole is relatively symmetric




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  Focal slowing is noted in drowsiness
with dropout of faster frequency activity in the right hemisphere compared to the left




Sleep is characterized by vertex waves and spindles.  Stage II sleep also includes some focality and
sleep morphologies are better developed on the left



Mild generalized slowing is present.

In drowsiness and sleep focal slowing is present on the right



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

DESCRIPTION  OF THE RECORD: 	In the wakefulness, the background showed intermittent alpha rhythm with 6.5 to 7 Hz when the patient is in the relaxed position, otherwise the background showed a lot of artifacts due to patient's anxiety and tension. An occasional Wicket activity noticed as well.  There was subtle right focal slowing and possible right temporal sharps which seemed to be sitting with the eye movements artifact.

There is some sharply contoured theta observed in the background with a suspicious sharp wave seen early on which is difficult to localize. During hyperventilation there is an increase in amplitude, as well as an increase in activity at
the vertex again. With the use of a circle montage, there is again this question of a vertex  sharp wave observed when the patient has not reached the appropriate stages of sleep in which vertex pathology is normally seen.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Disorganized background with non-appreciable posterior alpha rhythm. Background  shows a slow theta pattern throughout. At times in the record there are occasional periodic discharges seen in both hemispheres but of a greater intensity on the left. They are located mostly in the left parietal region and in the same region on the right and some are seen also in the temporal regions. These are not regular occurrences in the record and the patient returns to more of that slow theta pattern as it continues. During the record the patient is stimulated with an increase in muscle artifact and minimal response on the record of alertness. On the video there is some twitching seen of the left forearm, but there is no correlated EEG activity at this time in the record.

HR: 	66 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Slowing of the background  with mostly a theta pattern bilaterally; occasionally  delta.
2. 	Periodic discharges seen with the left greater than right maximum which occasionally occurs on the record.

CLINICAL  CORRELATION:  Arm twitching is seen on the video and is not consistent an EEG correlation for epilepsy. The periodic discharges are occasional and with a little bit more reactivity on the left than the right. This could be consistent with either structural damage or an encephalopathy  picture as well as the slowing of the background which is a non-specific  finding.

In addition, there are occasional left mid to anterior temporal high amplitude sharp waves noted. The right hemisphere demonstrates generous beta and there is mild background slowing seen intermittently, but there is a glimpse-of an alpha rhythm.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left temporal sharp waves.
2. Focal slowing from the left hemisphere.
3. Mild background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Despite the technical challenges described above, this EEG clearly demonstrates sharp waves. The amplitude asymmetry was seen in the first study performed in 2008.

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the right temporooccipital region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild, right, temporooccipital

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm was 9-10 Hz in frequency 30-50 microvolts in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Stage 1 and stage 2 sleep are characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm and slowing of the background and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact, and presence of posts, K complexes, vertex sharp transients, and sleep spindles.  There are also intermittent bursts of bitemporal slowing at F7/T3 and F8/T4 lasting for 1-2 seconds.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies, and results in a symmetric driving response.  Hyperventilation was performed and resulted in slowing of the background activity.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through drowsiness due to bitemporal slowing.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Bitemporal slowing is suggestive of bilateral structural abnormalities or bilateral cerebral dysfunction.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record.  No seizures are captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures. If clinically indicated, a repeat EEG or continuous bedside EEG or ambulatory, an EEG monitoring maybe helpful.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and drowsy
record in an individual who is primarily drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall waking background is relatively low
voltage with an 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low
voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Features of drowsiness included an increase in beta
followed by vertex waves and spindles. The patient had spontaneous arousals from
sleep. The patient reports to the technologist that she feels like she is about to have a
seizure, but the EEG at that time demonstrates a relatively normal pattern with
generous beta. Lambda is seen in wakefulness.
HR: 96 bpm

These are associated with fear.  Also, a feeling as if she is on a boat.  Patient was feeling almost back to herself.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, antidepressants, other medications (suboptimal adherent).
INTRODUCTION:  Extended, digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  The patient was somewhat symptomatic during the EEG, reporting disequilibrium.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the EEG demonstrates an awake pattern with a symmetric reactive alpha rhythm.  This is disrupted by intermittent bursts of rhythmic right temporal delta with admixed sharp waves.  The bursts of sharp waves and delta are on the order of 5-10-15 seconds in duration.  No alteration in the patient's motor or sensory symptoms were seen in association with these discharges.  The patient's responses are slowed, but the tech who spends 40 minutes with the patient, finds that the patient's responsiveness is not so significantly different than the sections of the record without the bursts.  As the recording concludes, the epileptiform activity is decreasing, but there remains some rhythmic right temporal slowing.  The sharp waves are significantly more discreet.
Photic stimulation was performed at the end of the record.  A driving response was identified.  In the final minutes of the recording, another more brief burst of right temporal sharp waves was noted.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Well-defined high amplitude right temporal sharp waves.
Bursts of rhythmic temporal theta.
Bursts of rhythmic slowing and sharp waves lasting between 5 and 13 seconds without significant change in the patient's clinical status.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings suggest a highly irritative focus.  This may be a postictal study, but ongoing vigilance is essential (the patient was admitted to the hospital based on this result).

INTRODUCTION: .Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness the background EEG is
mildly disorganized with 11 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, and there is bilateral frontal
slowing in theta range. Hyperventilation was done early in the record, and it increased in
the bilateral frontal slowing. Photic stimulation was also performed. and it elicits minimal
driving. á

During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
flash rates.  HR was 54
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the
medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard  10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.	The patient had just come from the emergency room having received the Dilantin and he had a seizure in the EEG lab removing his EEG electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the recording starts out, the patient is awake and reasonably cooperative.  There is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm observed. As the tracing again, the patient is awake with a 9.5 Hz, 30 mV posterior dominate rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by
slow-rolling eye movements. Hyperventilation is initiated early in the record, at 13:30 the patient is in the middle of hyperventilation.  At this time, 13:30:50 there is an arousal.   This is followed by the appearance of beta at 13:30:55, with repetitive sharp activity and theta maximum in the left temporal region, but with some bilateral representation.  As this continues at 13:31:07, there is little in the way of clinical manifestations.  By 13:31:10, the patient is starting to look from side to side.  He looks somewhat startled or frightened. The technologist calls the patient.  The patient's is
observed to be chewing, at 13:31:20, with repetitive sharp waves in left temporal region. He seems to be having automatic movements, face and but the audio is not
discernable.  The EEG goes on to be obscured with muscle.  As the patient's behaviors change, at 13:31:44, as he does that he has had head turning to the right. He gets up, he rotating around and looking all the way to the right.  He starts to turn around and around and he puts his head down. At that point, he rolls back towards his back and he has tonic clonic activity with his back to the camera with tonic stiffening and then clonic by 13:32:05. he seems to be having tonic clonic activity in the right arm but the left arm is stiff. Foaming at the mouth is seen at 13:32:19.  while he has eye deviation to the left he is jerking primarily with the right arm.  The characteristic slow pattern at the close of the clonic tonic seizure as the motor activity slows, is observed at 13:32:39. This seizure  ends at 13:32:48.  This is a 2 minute seizure.  Afterwards, the patient is awake, but agitated and he starts to get up and move about. There is a caregiver present with the technologist who applies oxygen.  The patient removes all the electrodes and receives 4 mg of Ativan. The EEG concludes at 13:40:02, where behaviorally the

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  At the start of this record you see a markedly abnormal EEG.  The left hemisphere shows a low voltage, slow and suppressed background.  There is an asymmetry with the right hemisphere showing regular polyspike activity in the P4, T4, T6 regions.  Overall there is an extensive spread of activity that seemed to continue throughout this record. There is no seizure activity seen in this record even with extensive epileptiform discharges coming from the right hemisphere. There is some suppression of the record in between the discharges sometimes lasting up to 3 seconds.

HR:	78 bpm and irregular

IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Left hemispheric suppression over the background.
Continuous right hemispheric polyspike activity with the parietal and temporal regions with a large field of spread.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:   There is no seizure activity recorded on this record, however, the regular polyspike activity in the right hemisphere shows the patient have a very irritative focus for seizure activity. The suppression of the left hemisphere can be consistent with a history of previous stroke in the past.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel  EKG. Patient is somnolent but moving about and answering questions.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a slow pattern bilaterally with theta-delta pattern.  In addition, superimposed upon this is a rhythmic delta from the right posterior quadrant and in this region there is also a sharp wave in the right posterotemporal region.

The patient has a seizure while working with the tech. The seizure seems to begin while the tech is working with the patient and the first ictal changes are at 15:48. The ictal changes include an increase in theta frequency activity.

By 01:49:00 very clear ictal changes are noted with the patient looking, instead of at the right, he is looking at the left and blinking. He remains responsive to the technologist at
0:48:55 as this activity builds up.  He seems to be confused, but he does follow commands and closes his eyes at 0:49:14. The tech is working with the patient so she does not observe the rhythmic repetitive theta activity in the right temporal region which spreads to the parietal and occipital region as well. He stops speaking, though.  By
15:50 the physician comes to examine the patient who is clearly confused and unable to follow commands, with roving eye movements.   He does provide a few words at
15:50:33. This electrographic seizure has a clear end at 15:51:11 and likely onset gradual evolution of faster frequencies at 15:48 for a total seizure duration of approximately 3 minutes.

Afterwards, the EEG returns to its previous, slower periodic sharp wave from the right hemisphere which gradually build up at 15:54:03.   Facial twitching is noted.

The second seizure is a grand mal seizure but starts with facial twitching and actually has a complex partial component where the patient actually seems to be somewhat

responsive and uncomfortable with focal and then asynchronous twitching. The second seizure is significantly longer in duration.  The tonic-clonic section of it is still relatively prolonged and is at least4  seconds in duration.

After the second seizure which has the tonic-clonic components, the overall EEG is quite slow but the periodic complexes in the right posterior quadrant persist.

HR:	150  bpm


IMPRESSION: Normal bedside EEG due to:
1. 	Tonic-clonic seizure.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG demonstrates an intrahemispheric  asymmetry.  There is a discernible 9Hz 50 microvolt alpha rhythm on the right which is disrupted on the left.  In addition, there is a skull defect with head rocking in the right central region and overall disruption of mu activity on the right compared to the left. Features of drowsiness include a drop out of faster frequency activity which occurs on the right much sooner on the left.
A seizure occurs at 09:53:03. It begins with the subtle development of alpha frequency out of the right temporal scalp electrodes which evolve.  No definitive clinical signs are seen until 09:53:47 when he starts to blink.  He seems to be motionless looking at the camera.  There may be some switching in the neck, but nothing that the video observer can see.  By 09:53:47 he is staring and blinking, looking to the left.  There is clear frequency evolution at 09:54:37.  There is no testing performed in the seizure and postictal slowing is noted with the end of the seizure occurring at 09:55:22 to 09:56.  By
09:59 the EEG looks postictal.  It has returned to the slowing that was previously noted
on the right with the return of alpha briefly on the left.
Notable features during this relatively prolonged, 2 minute complex partial seizure, includes the appearance of alpha frequency activity bilaterally, although there previously had not been alpha frequency on the right.  This activity is clearly pathological and it is not the alpha rhythm which reacts to eye opening.  It is actually faster frequency than it is posterior dominant rhythm and it is associated with repetitive sharp activity at T2.
The postictal recording includes some sharp waves on the left.

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG was performed  at bedside using 10-20 system of electrode placement  with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is recorded in a routine room.
There is no seizure spike detection employed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Through the course of this EEG, there are 6 complex partial seizures recorded.  The clinical manifestations of the seizures appear to be quite subtle for those who are not familiar with epilepsy.  The patient stares, blinks, may look to the left, and has impaired responsiveness.  He has some automatic movements.
Epileptiform activity during the seizures is characterized  by rhythmic 9 Hz activity in the right temporal region, including the right posterior temporal region.  This activity shows frequency evolution transitioning  to theta and then delta with sharply contoured activity at T2, T4, and T6. Postictal features for these seizures include marked slowing from the right hemisphere, particularly the temporal region with rhythmic theta delta, and then a lower voltage more suppressed pattern.
The seizures are relatively infrequent, but reoccur at 16:20, 16:43.  That seizure is characterized by chewing activity,  02:28 to 02:48 in which there is really little in the way of clinical correlate, but there is the clear alpha frequency activity on the right with a slower pattern on the left, 03:06,
04:52, 05:09. Some of the discharges  have little in the way of a clinical correlate. The recording ends at 6:00 a.m.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic simulation is performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The beginning of the record shows marked intrahemispheric asymmetry.  The right hemisphere  is much slower and is featureless.  The left looks close to normal with a 9.5 Hz, 50 microvolt alpha rhythm.  There are areas of T2 T4 arrhythmic slowing, as well as sharply contoured waves in the same region. Photic stimulation is performed  and produces shifting slowing from the T2 T4 region and shifts to the T4 T6 region. There appears to be a small driving response on the left, but not on the right with photic stimulation.

Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by low-to-moderate amplitude 10.5-11 Hz alpha rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-
7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Polymorphic and rhythmic delta activity (TIRDA) is frequently observed over the left temporal
region during wakefulness and increases during drowsiness.  Two focal electrographic seizures are
captured.  Each lasts ~ 1 minute.  No clinical correlate is reported by the EEG technologist.  The
patient is not formally tested during these seizures.  They occur during drowsiness.  Seizures start
with rhythmic left anterior temporal delta activity, most pronounced over F7/t1 region.  It gradually
increases in amplitude, becomes more prominent and slightly increases in frequency from ~2 Hz to
~2.5-3 Hz.  There is some reflection  to the left parasagittal leads and left lateral/ temporal leads.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.

drowsiness and do not have a clear clinical correlate. These findings are indicative of an
epileptogenic focus in left anterior temporal region, and given the clinical history of partial

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is actually increasingly awake and responsive during the EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is remarkable for a fair amount of muscle movement artifact. There is a beta frequency background on the left with generous beta.  There is irregular activity in the right hemisphere with arrhythmic delta activity with variable maximum, including frontal temporal, posterior temporal, or right central/central temporal.  Arrhythmic delta accompanies this. Later portions in the record, when the patient is a bit more awake, seem to be associated with a bit less of this activity, but it  is relatively continuous.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due:
1.	Generalized background slowing.
2.	Superimposed focal slowing on the right.
3. 	Sharp waves from the right, including right central temporal.


CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	This EEG supports a highly irritative focus in the right hemisphere.  Given the fever, nuchal rigidity, and abnormal CSF, these findings should be interpreted in the context of clinical and imaging data.

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV,  10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.   During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.

No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. Hr was 66

Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges

Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Please note this is different from the previous EEG read on 04/13/2009 which revealed left anterior temporal slow and rare sharp waves.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation and
hyperventilation are performed. This is a 1 hour sleep deprived record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized, but
somewhat slow, with an 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Photic stimulation shows scant driving
response. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing some background
slowing, as well as a bit of arrhythmic delta activity in the posterior temporal regions bilaterally.
This is followed by drowsiness with anterior spread of the alpha rhythm, followed by vertex
waves. Frequent arousals from stage I and stage II sleep are observed. A handful of
asynchronous vertex waves are observed with shifting asymmetries in the right or left central
region. Snore artifact is also observed in stage I sleep.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




Diffuse excess beta activity is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.







EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

A single brief burst (~1.5 seconds) of high amplitude ~2.5 Hz generalized frontally predominant
moderate-to-high amplitude polyspikes is captured towards the end of the recording during stage II
sleep.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. A single brief burst of high amplitude ~2.5 Hz generalized frontally predominant moderate-to-high
amplitude polyspikes is captured during stage II sleep.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This finding is suggestive of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.



Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and sleep study.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  During wakefulness, there is a disorganized background. The posterior dominant rhythm reaches at the start 6 Hz and up to 35 microvolts. As the record continues and patient reaches maximal wakefulness during stimulation, the background rhythm reaches at its maximum 9 Hz. There is an interhemispheric asymmetry seen with some focal slowing of the right hemisphere.  Sleep is seen with vertex waves and spindles and a little epochs of sleep, where the patient quickly awakens.  Hyperventilation accentuates the focal slowing in the right hemisphere.  Photic stimulation shows some scant driving, which is seen a bit better on the right posterior hemisphere.
HR:  66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Generalized slowing of the background, which does reach 9 Hz, but the majority of the background is slow.
2. 	More focal slowing seen in the right hemisphere.
Scant driving seen asymmetrically  and better in the right posterior region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is no epileptiform activity seen in this record. The generalized slowing of the background is nonspecific.  Initially, the focal slowing is seen in the right hemisphere,  but the driving is actually better in the right hemisphere,  which is incongruent and not initially expected.  The focal differences could be secondary to a structural abnormality and could get imaging this patient.  Clinical correlation is recommended.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During wakefulness, a minimally disorganized background
is seen. The posterior dominant rhythm reaches 8.5 to 9 hertz and up to 20 microvolt's.
Throughout the record wicket waves are seen. Throughout the record bursts of irregular theta
activity is seen which is higher amplitude on the left especially when the patient becomes
drowsy or during hyperventilation. These bursts are sharply contoured with a question of an
underlying sharp wave but none is ever seen. During stage 2 sleep vertex waves, K complexes
and spindles are seen. During hyperventilation there is bilateral slowing and the increase in the
sharply contoured bursts, irregular bursts theta. During photic stimulation driving is seen.

2. Bursts of sharply contoured irregular theta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Compared to the patient's previous study done here in 2005, the
background slowing has improved. There was a question of an underlying sharp wave that
never develops even through stage 2 sleep. A prolonged sleep EEG may be considered.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  The EKG electrode does not show a very good rhythm, a very low amplitude rhythm.  In addition, the impedances on the occipital electrodes and the right frontal and central electrodes were very high due to difficulty with the patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a recording that is mainly in sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG in limited wakefulness reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region and independently in the right mid temporal region, both of which are nonspecific in regards to etiology.  In addition, the patient appears to have some mild diffuse generalized dysfunction, which is also nonspecific in regard to etiology.  No seizures or clear epileptiform discharges were seen.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is a one-hour sleep-deprived record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a well-organized background with 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient rapidly drifts in and out of sleep with POSTS. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, but the patient is drifting
into stage II  sleep. Spikey POSTS are observed in the abundant stage II  sleep record. In  the sleep recording, there is an amplitude asymmetry for the POSTS which are high amplitude and on one occasion a left parietal sharp wave.  Additionally, with this subtle asymmetry there is also noted asymmetry with more muscle artifact on the right. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is essentially asleep and does not significantly activate the record.

HR:	78 bpm


IMPRESSION: Questionably abnormal EEG due to:
1.  A single left parietal sharp wave.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:   The amplitude asymmetry of the POSTS is an acceptable variant. A single sharp wave is a nonspecific finding. It may represent artifact, and there are other artifacts noted in this record at this time.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. The patient experiences a coughing spell during the EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness,  the background EEG includes symmetric reactive alpha rhythm. The patient rapidly drifts off to sleep with an increase in background slowing. A coughing spell is associated with movement artifact, but also with an increase in theta and delta.

Heart rate is 104 increasing to 120 BPM with coughing.


IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:   No epileptiform features were observed in this EEG. The coughing was associated with an increase in slowing and an increase in heart rate. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged study capturing more significant sleep may be useful.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 7-7.5 Hz in frequency, well-formed on the left side, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is 5-7 Hz diffuse theta activity noted during wakefulness.  There is attenuation and loss of faster frequencies in the right hemisphere, most pronounced in posterior quadrant with intermittent slowing in the left cerebral hemisphere.  The lethargic state is characterized by further slowing of the background and disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm.  Heart rate was 90 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal EEG recording due to:
Diffuse slowing of the background with theta activity seen in wakefulness.
Slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
Attenuation and loss of faster frequencies and also slowing in the left posterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings are suggestive of either metabolic, toxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of sedating medication or bilateral cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  Attenuation and loss of faster frequencies in the left cerebral hemisphere is likely due to the patient's history of stroke.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record.  No seizures is captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.  If clinically indicated, a continuous bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.

HISTORY:
A 37-year-old female who presents for followup EEG with past medical history significant for generalized epilepsy. Last seizure was reported in February 2011, with fall and loss of consciousness with urinary incontinence and postictal confusion lasting for an hour.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
Posterior dominant alpha rhythm is seen at 9 to 10Hz frequency and 20 microvolt amplitude which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. Frontocentral beta rhythm is also seen. Stage I sleep is seen and is normal. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed, which are also normal.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A one hour, digital video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG)

was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV, and


photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.7

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, POSTS sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  Sleep was not

sustained.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no reactivity to visual,


auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no

INTRODUCTION: Digital Video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a vigorous, 50-70 microvolt 10 Hertz upper rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, fronto-central beta activity. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude data background. Photic stimulation elicits harmonic and spur harmonic driving. As the photic stimulation begins the patient looks to the left and covers her face. She has her hands over her eyes and appears to be crying. When the technologist turns towards the patient at 10:18:08 the technologist interacts with the patient who begins to have jerking. The patient exhibits pelvic thrusting and neck thrusting and involuntary jerkins. The jerking of the right arm persists even as the study ends at 10:21 but the patient is able to look and interact with the physician. The EEG demonstrates a normal awake pattern throughout the entire event. There is no spike in wave activity and a well defined alpha rhythm is observed.
HR: 60-120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The behavior recorded was not associated with epileptiform activity. In addition, the behavioral features of the event would be very unusual for a seizure. These findings were discussed with the clinical team.

Photic stimulation is performed at the end of the EEG as the patient transitions in and out of sleep.  In some cases photic stimulation also appears to elicit brief bursts of similar activity, but there was one burst that occurred just prior to the photic stimulation.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Some sections of the records are well organized with rhythmic 8 Hz alpha rhythm, others demonstrate a little bit more disorganization with rhythmic slowing, particularly in the posterior regions. This is accentuated by hyperventilation. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta, again with slight accentuation of the theta seen in the posterior regions, somewhat left more so than the right.

stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 30 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm, a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity,
and a small amount of frontal theta. The frontal theta is overall symmetric but with a
slight asymmetry. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the
background. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. A small amount of excess theta in the frontal regions, left greater than right.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The theta described is nonspecific in this context and
could be due to this patient's medications in that it is slightly asymmetric. Correlation
with imaging is suggested.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial sections of much of the waking record unfortunately includes head rocking artifact in the posterior regions. There is a 10.5 hertz alpha rhythm which is higher amplitude on the right than the left and posterior activity is always higher amplitude on the right than the left in this individual. Brief stage II sleep includes vertex waves, spindles and POSTS. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response, but the driving response is somewhat asymmetric, more vigorous on the left compared to the right. In addition, there is also a suggestion of a subharmonic driving response elicited on the left more so than the right.

IMPRESSION: Equivocally abnormal EEG due to:
1. Asymmetric photic stimulation described above.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The head rocking artifact is in the same region as the area of potential abnormality.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, but the overall background is somewhat disorganized.  There is a small amount of shifting slowing and a small amount of background theta.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic theta.  Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
Notable in this record are paroxysmal bursts of rhythmic, high amplitude theta, some of which demonstrate frequency evolution.  In addition, there are irregular bursts of 4-5 Hz spike and wave activity noted in the frontal regions.  On occasion, some of these seem to be a bit more prominent in the right.  These bursts are overall, relatively asynchronous.
Hyperventilation produced 1 of these bursts of high amplitude, theta frequency activity with a questionable right frontal spike and slow wave complex as well as some rhythmic theta.
Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response.  The photic stimulation may also have accentuated some of the epileptiform activity, although on the whole.  The epileptiform activity was pre or post the photic stimulation.

TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.

Sleep is not sustained



No generalized slowing is present.  Rare shifting frontal focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Rare irregular frontally predominant bursts of 3-4 spike and wave with bursts of 2-2.5 seconds duration
are noted in wakefulness.


Focal sharp waves were seen in early drowsiness at T3 and P3. Infrequent.

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

There are bursts of frontal 4 Hz activity with slight R frontal maximum, but without a definitive spike.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Hyperventilation: elicits bursts of sharply contoured and at times asynchronous slowing, but no
definitive spikes.


Photic Stimulation: in addition to a driving response, 4 Hz frontal high amplitude theta occurs in
brief 1 second burst with 11 Hz stimuli


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of  54bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG.

1. Irregular  bursts of 3-4 spike and wave activity


2. Irregular bursts of frontal theta, slightly asymmetric

3. Rare focal sharp waves T3  Or P3

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is well organized with a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Photic stimulation elicits driving. After photic stimulation is over, the patient had some jerking of her shoulders but not in association with the flashing lights. After the photic stimulation continues, the recording continues and the patient had intermittent jerking of her shoulders. The shoulders jerk forwards and backwards.
The shoulder jerking is not associated with epileptiform activity in the EEG. It is sometimes associated with upwards thrusting of her upper chest. She stares straight ahead during the events.
As the record continues, a physician examines the patient. The interaction with the physician and the patient is associated with increasing motor activity including eye blinking, mouth opening and closing, a little bit of alternating movements to right or left, and then some rotatory movements of the torso. When the movements stop, the EEG shows a normal awake pattern. The patient is staring off to space after the event ends.

MEDICATIONS: Carbatrol, Keppra, Topiramate.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively low voltage with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. It is difficult to define an alpha rhythm in this background. Hyperventilation is performed with good effort producing an increase in amplitude of the background. Drowsiness is characterized by the appearance of lower voltage theta and delta. As the patient drifts into sleep in this low voltage record, some of the delta appears to be a bit more prominent in the left hemisphere. Photic stimulation elicits scan driving in this low voltage record.

HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with more of a low voltage beta frequency pattern.
2. Focal slowing from the left hemisphere.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified today. In this low voltage record, the presence of the focal slowing on the left relevant to the right correlates with the previous craniotomy and neuropathology. No epileptiform activity seen since 2003.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 51-year-old, right-handed gentleman with history of aneurysm clipping, with history of seizures.  The patient has been seizure free for 5 years.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Topamax.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background activity was characterized by absence of a clear posterior dominant rhythm and a very low amplitude voltage recording.  There is a diffuse beta activity seen throughout the recording.  Stage 1 sleep is characterized by disappearance of a muscle and eye blink artifact and the presence of vertex sharp waves.  Stage 2 sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.  Some focal slow waves are noted at anterior, temporal, and central area on the left side with some increase in faster frequencies at times.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to left frontocentral slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left frontocentral region, which is consistent with the known surgery.  The absence of a normal posterior dominant rhythm, although atypical could be a normal variant.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This 50-year-old male, status post aneurysm clipping in approximately 1987-88, seizure free for many years, but now with intermittent spells in which he is perhaps inattentive to his mother, and then tells her that he is all right.  Bilateral encephalomalacia.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This was a technically unsatisfactory EEG with most impedances below 5 kilo ohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.  This was a 40-minute EEG capturing wakefulness and sleep.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is very low voltage, and at times almost featureless.  Much of the recording was at a sensitivity of 3.  The overall background includes a mixture of theta and beta.  Artifacts due to the deformity of the patient's scalp on the left were noted and a breach rhythm with an increase in amplitude of theta on the left was observed.

Photic stimulation elicited questionable supra-harmonic driving.

Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background and slightly accentuated the rhythmic slowing on the left frontal region.

Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in the rhythmic slowing in the left frontocentral region and an increase in beta.  Muscle artifact was noted throughout the record.

Heart rate 66 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging, but abnormal EEG due to,
1. Low voltage pattern.
2. Generalized background slowing.
3. In the context of a breach rhythm, left rhythmic frontal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is one of many EEGs for this individual.  The last 3 EEGs have demonstrated epileptiform activity.  If additional information is needed, consideration for an alternative monitoring strategy may be appropriate.

INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was preformed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient keeps a log. He is able to push the button for all of the events that he experiences. He has multiple episodes of dizziness or disorienting feeling.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 hertz posterior dominant rhythm which is symmetrically reactive. Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background theta with vertex waves, spindles and stage II sleep. There is an epoch in which REM sleep is seen.
In the interictal EEG, there is a single left temporal sharp wave.
Events: The patient has multiple dizzy spells including 129, 125, 312, 336, 536, 546 and then there are no additional push buttons noted.
Although not all of the seizures have a clear clinical correlate and some have only either subtle theta or subtle disruption of faster frequency activity in left temporal region, some have clear, rhythmic 4 hertz theta from the left temporal region with some spread to the frontocentral region bilaterally, typically lasting 20-40 seconds.

Event time 12930: the patient has a dizzy spell characterized by decreased alpha frequency activity from the left temporal region and a brief burst of left temporal theta.
Event time: 2:32 p.m.: There is a brief burst of left temporal theta which differs from the background.
Event time: 3:12p.m.: Aura of dizziness, left temporal theta.
Event #3: Aura characterized by dizziness time 335 to 33729, rhythmic temporal theta as described above.
Event #4: Subtle left temporal theta at 3:53:52.
Event #5: 536, very subtle left temporal theta.
Event #6: Aura 5:46:13, brief burst of left temporal theta.
HR: 100 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG monitoring due to:
1. Subtle, intermittent attenuation of alpha frequency activity in the left temporal region.
2. A handful of well defined auras characterized by rhythmic 4 hertz theta with clear frequency evolution. The characteristic seizure pattern for this patient includes attenuation of alpha in the region, then the theta and then some bilateral frontocentral spread.
3. Rare interictal findings including sharp waves in the left temporal region and sharply contoured theta. An example of this is at 4:35:37 a.m. on the morning of the second.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of a localization related
mechanism for epilepsy. These findings were reviewed with the patient during the hospitalization.

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The  patient is somnolent throughout the study.  The background is characterized by the presence of
a low-voltage, mixed theta delta pattern with generous, diffuse beta.  Rhythmic theta is noted in the
temporal regions, left greater than right



Marked  generalized slowing is present.

Left temporal focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Rare, sharply contoured slowing and occasional left temporal sharp waves were noted maximum T3.

Beta rhythm is also seen with 15-25 Hz frequency and 10-15 microvolt amplitude in the frontal central region in small amounts.  Stage 1 and stage 2 sleep records are also seen. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are normal.  There is focal slowing noted at F8, T4, and T4 electrodes of 2-4 Hz frequency and 20-70 microvolt amplitude, however, seen occasionally.  No seizures are seen.
HR:  N/A
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Occasional focal slowing seen in the right mid and anterior temporal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with focal cerebral dysfunction in the right temporal lobe which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake record with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9Hz, 40 microvolt posterior-dominant rhythm. The alpha rhythm is sometimes disrupted from the right hemisphere. There is some shifting arrhythmic delta activity identified bilaterally. High amplitude right anterior temple spike and slow wave complexes are observed most of which are maximum at T-2 but some of which are maximum T4 and T6. All are high amplitude, sometimes exceeding 100 microvolts with a generous field of spread within the right hemisphere and disruption of faster
frequency activity. Hyperventilation clearly accentuates the epileptiform activity. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. There is some bilateral posterior slowing and drowsiness. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. The focal right greater than left posterior slowing is noted in photic stimulation. Stage I sleep starts to emerge at the end of the EEG but sleep is not sustained.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. High amplitude right anterior temporal spike and slow wave complexes.
2. Right hemisphere and right temporal focal slowing.
3. Sharp waves in the right hemisphere with variable maximum but most of which are maximum in the temple regions
4. A modest degree of background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings support a structural process as well as a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.

Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of  electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG Is well organized with  a 10.5Hz alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta. At the end of  hyperventilation, there is a high amplitude frontally predominant paroxysmal burst. There  appears to be an underlying spike or fast component prior to 4 bursts of 3to 4 Hz activity. A  second burst is noted at the close of t he hyperventilation, and this burst is a bit more posteriorly  predominant with a discrete either spike or fast activity prior to again 3 Hz discharges. The  background Immediately returns to a relatively awake pattern. Following this, another  paroxysmal burst without as clearly defined spike activity is noted, but there is some faster  frequency activity, similar to paroxysmal fast activity, noted prior to this with some both 13 and 19Hz activity. Features of drowsiness include stow-rolling eye movements. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 60bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 3 to_4 Hz paroxysmal higher amplitude delta with suspicious underlying spike activity.

INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the emergency room using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement
with one channel of EKG. The patient is examined during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
The background EEG begins With a marked asymmetry between the two hemispheres. It is very low-voltage suppressed
with a paucity of beta activity on the left. In contrast, the right includes generous beta, diffusely. In this relatively
low-voltage pattern on the left, there are subtle, periodic sharp waves or sharply contoured delta at C3-P3. As the
recording continues, the patient is starting to move about, there is additional beta activity noted from both hemispheres.
The periodic complexes are still apparent underneath the muscle and movement artifact. Stimulation of the patient
produces an increase in muscle artifact. As the recording continues, the epileptiform activity transitions to a bit more of a
frontotemporal broadly contoured discharge with a broad field of spread.
Heart rate 104 BPM.

IMPRESSION:
Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1.
Initially, a markedly slow and suppressed pattern on the left.
2.
An asymmetry that persists throughout the record with a much slower pattern on the left.
3.
A periodic complex seen intermittently from the left. The patient was a bit more agitated by the end of the record, but
on the video, no jerking can be discerned during the video to correlate with the periodic complexes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
In this individual with recent seizures characterized by right-sided jerking, the periodic complexes and focal slowing should
be correlated with imaging to exclude a structural pathology. No prolonged seizures were recorded.

Description:
During maximal wakefulness, the background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm,
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta
activity and becomes more disorganized, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes
intermittent.  Vertex waves appear that are at times asymmetric, and frequent generalized bursts of
high amplitude theta and delta activity are seen.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to
moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal and rarely in the right
temporal regions during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Predominately during
drowsiness, polymorphic high amplitude left temporal sharp waves appear with variable fields with
phase reversal at F7, T3, T5 and at times develop into a pseudoperiodic pattern.  Rare right
temporal sharp waves are also present with phase reversal F8 and T4.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional
abnormalities.  HR is 66.

MEDICATIONS: Depakote and Keppra.

INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is initially intubated. Afterwards, he is wearing a face mask. The patient is obtunded in the first section of the record and progressively more awake over time.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial sections of the record demonstrated a low voltage beta pattern particularly a frontal beta pattern and some shifting posterior in delta. There is some head rocking artifacts and sweat. Over the course of the long term monitor, stimulation of the patient starts to produce an arousal response. Later on, eye opening and eye closure is noted when someone is at the bedside with the patient and by the end of the EEG, he is intermittently awake with low voltage beta pattern. At other points, there is a somewhat slow background in wakefulness.

HR: 120 bpm max

IMPRESSION: This long term video EEG monitoring is remarkable for:
1. Initially slow pattern with frontal beta.
2. The absence of epileptiform activity.
3. The eventual appearance of a relatively normal awake pattern.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. These findings should be placed into the appropriate clinical context.

INTRODUCTION:  A 20 minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is quite fragile, but awake.  He is responsive to questions.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The right hemisphere is low voltage and relatively featureless.  The left hemisphere is remarkable for a craniotomy defect, but also periodic, high amplitude delta activity with a left central parietal spike and wave complex.  The spike and wave complex is periodic in nature and has the periodicity of about 8 per 10 seconds.  There is a small amount of waxing and waning of the epileptiform discharge, but no clear ictal pattern.  Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta in the left hemisphere as well as eye movement.
Heart rate:  80 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
A continuous periodic discharge, which includes a spike as well as periodic delta from the left hemisphere, maximum in the central parietal region.
Markedly slow and suppressed pattern from the right with volume conduction of the epileptiform discharge on the left to the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The patient seems to be awake and interactive despite the discharge described above.  In addition, stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting response on top of the periodic complex.  The discharge described above may be a chronic finding or a post-ictal finding, but does not appear to be to be a true seizure.   Ongoing vigilance is suggested. No clinical seizures noted at this time.

INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with acceptable impedances, although there is a prominent craniotomy defect.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background from the right hemisphere includes a low voltage, continuous, primarily beta frequency pattern.  The left hemisphere demonstrates a prominent breach rhythm.  There are bursts of rhythmic 3 to 4 Hz activity of 1 to 3 seconds duration.  Some of these are associated with a sharp waves.  The bursts of rhythmic slowing with left mid temporal sharp waves are more prominent as the patient became drowsy.
Heart rate: 54 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
A marked interhemispheric asymmetry.
A low voltage slow pattern from the right with primarily beta frequency activity.
A pattern from the left with higher amplitude delta, a prominent reach, and a left mid temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is one of many EEGs for this adult, who has been evaluated for status epilepticus and seizures.  The epileptiform activity today is primarily left mid temporal, which in some ways is similar to the continuous EEG monitoring.  A contrast to February 2015 EEG monitor, which identified epileptiform activity from the left hemisphere, but that epileptiform activity was much more prominent in the central parietal region.
This EEG continues to support a focal mechanism for this patient's seizures.  The epileptiform activity is in the region of the patient's head trauma.  The bilateral background slowing supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively low voltage with generous beta and a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  With testing the alpha improves to 10 Hz.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  Wicket is noted in relaxed wakefulness. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record.  The patient is falling asleep during hyperventilation with vertex waves and spindles.  There are some normal variants, including small sharp spikes of sleep, but there is also some left temporal focal slowing.  The patient transitions in and out of stage II sleep.  Again, subtle left temporal focal slowing is noted.  Simple sharp waves, as are common in normal variants, are also noted in the left temporal region. These are again noted with photic stimulation.  The patient is once again falling asleep during photic stimulation.

HR:    60 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Subtle left temporal focal slowing.
2. Left temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The left temporal sharp waves have a simple morphology as can be seen in a normal variant.  However, they occur in the context of focal slowing and are more suggestive of a focal mechanism for epilepsy.  In comparison to a previous EEG, both EEGs demonstrate some of the same normal variants and some of the same unique challenges.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively low voltage with 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Temporal wicket was noted.  In addition, there is subtle, left temporal focal slowing which was accentuated by hyperventilation.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta followed by vertex waves.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:






A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  There are
other sections of the record when the patient appears to be awake, the alpha rhythm is 7-8 Hz




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen. POSTS present



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



intermittent generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Occasional wicket waves are noted during drowsiness over the temporal regions, L>R



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.




EVENTS: There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.





HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1.  Intermittent slowing of the background and apparent wakefulness

CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are nonspecific.  The pharmacy may contribute to the pattern described above.
Additional evaluation, including EEG monito, may be helpful given the recent seizure related injury.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm of 40 mV.  There is a small amount of background theta noted in the background.
Hyperventilation is performed early in the record producing an increase in theta.  At the end of hyperventilation and as the patient drifts off into drowsiness, there is a subtle asymmetry with a bit more irregular theta on the left, but this disappears as the patient transitions towards stage II sleep.  Muscle artifact persists at times into the transition into sleep. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake and briefly drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the EEG is well organized with a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm. As the patient becomes drowsy, there is somewhat asynchronous theta noted. In addition, there is a drop out of the alpha rhythm, a little faster in the left hemisphere with a little bit of slowing on the left relevant to the right. Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving with harmonic and super-harmonic driving. Super-harmonic driving is seen with faster frequency activity. Stage I sleep includes vertex waves.
HR: 60 bpm with occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1.Several asymmetries in the temporal region, particularly as the patient becomes drowsy with left greater than right temporal theta.
2. Disrupted alpha as the patient transitions toward sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen. In addition, there were no specific features to suggest an inherited mechanism for epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.  Impedances were less than 5 kilo-ohms with the exception of the T1 and T2 electrodes, 5.9 and 5.2 respectively.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG is low to medium amplitude with a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm.  Prominent lateral rectus eye artifact was noted.

Hyperventilation was performed early in the record.  The patient seemed to be falling asleep during hyperventilation.

During hyperventilation, and just following hyperventilation, high amplitude right anterior temporal spike and sharp waves were noted.  In addition, there is some subtle focal slowing in the right to mid anterior temporal region noted as the patient becomes drowsy following hyperventilation.  The remainder of the EEG is relatively symmetric but there is also some variable voltage subtle slowing noted at F3.  As the patient transitions in and out of sleep, rare right anterior spike and slow wave complexes were identified reaching 70 microvolts.  These were noted as the patient transitions in and out of stage 2 sleep.

Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response.  In addition, in photic stimulation, there is some subtle, lower voltage left frontocentral sharp waves with fast activity.  The patient seemed to be drifting off to sleep at the end of photic stimulation and again the right anterior temporal, well defined spike and slow wave complexes were noted.

Heart rate:  Irregular, 60 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
1. Well defined higher amplitude right anterior temporal spike and slow wave complexes accentuated by hyperventilation and drowsiness.
2. Subtle, intermittent focal slowing in the same distribution.
3. Additional area of the brain with lower voltage, fast activity or a lower voltage spike in the left frontocentral region with, at times, some associated focal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to a previous EEG which captured only wakefulness, epileptiform activity was identified in hyperventilation and drowsiness.  Some of this was in the region of the previous right hemispheric infarct but there was also some lower voltage activity in the left frontocentral region.

Additional evaluation for the irregular heart rate, noted in 2012 and 2013, may be warranted.

At times as the patient blinks or moves there appears to be some artifact and there appears to be slight improvement in the frequencies, but overall he remains generally slow at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV.  No activating procedures were performed.  No clear sleep architecture is seen.
Abnormal discharges:  Generalized slowing at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-40 mV.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to continuous moderate to severe generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches at 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Bursts of generalized spike and waves which is anterior predominant and symmetric, and bursts of 3-4 Hz were seen intermittently, at times with preceding polyspikes throughout the recording.  Some of them appeared more asymmetric on the right than the left, but the majority appear symmetric.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized spike and waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of epilepsy.  The discharges seen above are most commonly seen with a generalized type of epilepsy.  However, some of them appeared slightly asymmetric and may suggest a possible focal onset with secondary generalization.  Repeated EEG capturing seizures or clinical followup may aid in elucidating the clear classification.  These findings were reported to the consult team as soon as the EEG was read.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  There was problematic muscle artifact noted in the records.  This is an awake and asleep record.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, this is a relatively low-voltage EEG with 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by slowing the alpha rhythm with slow rolling eye movements, followed by vertex waves.  Brief spindles were noted in stage II sleep.

Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background.

Photic stimulation elicited a driving with superharmonic driving response.

Heart rate 78 beats per minute.

IMPRESSION:  Normal electroencephalogram in wakefulness and sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Despite the technical problems described above, this is a normal EEG.

This is the second normal EEG for this patient.  No epileptiform features were seen for either EEG.  If additional information is needed.

during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta
activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.

globally confused.  Found to have Acute infarct in the posterior

limb of the left internal capsule.




MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.




INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at

bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1

channel EKG.  This is a technically challenging record in a


patient who was poorly interactive with significant muscle

artifact.




DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background initially has low

voltage with generous beta and a glimpse of an 11 Hz alpha rhythm

and some central alpha and beta frequency activity.  There are


isolated bursts of slowing with lower voltage delta noted in the




background.  At the very end of the record, the patient seems to

be becoming more drowsy with a decrease in muscle and an increase


in slowing.




Heart rate 60 bpm.



IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging, but abnormal EEG due to:

1. Excess beta.


2. Intermittent isolated bursts of delta.

this record.  There were no epileptiform features seen.  Overall,

this EEG is more supportive of a global disturbance of cerebral

function.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a bedside record without hyperventilation and photic stimulation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there was a 10Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in beta.

In wakefulness, there were bursts of frontally predominant rhythmic high amplitude 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity.

No impairment of awareness was noted with the events.  The patient was able to answer questions even with very brief discharges, but again discharges are typically 1 to 1.5 seconds after going slow activity, lasting an another second at maximum duration.

The technologist notes 1 or 2 movements of the patient, but no definitive myoclonus was captured.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.  It was a technically acceptable record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Mu rhythm was noted, but testing was not performed to confirm this.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving with vigorous supra-harmonic driving.

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Fragments of a
symmetric posterior dominant rhythm are likely present, but interpretation is limited by near constant
eye movement artifact during wakefulness, including nystagmus artifact.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.





OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


1. A single left occipital sharply contoured theta wave is noted in drowsiness, not clearly epileptiform



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal, albeit limited (near constant eye movement artifact during wakefulness), awake and
drowsy routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.

TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:






The waking background is asymmetric.  The left hemisphere is slightly disorganized but with a
posterior dominant rhythm of 8 Hz, normal anterior-posterior gradient.  The right hemisphere
demonstrates a posterior dominant rhythm, when present of 9 Hz but with continuous, somewhat
arrhythmic delta activity noted in the right frontocentral frontal temporal regions with disruption of
faster frequency activity.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous sleep spindles and few K-
complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.  Continuous focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:      Photic Stimulation: No driving response was noted, the patient
seemed to be drifting off to sleep



EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION: Abnormal due to


1. Continuous right frontocentral focal slowing

2.  Mild disorganization on the left



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is routine  1 hour EEG is consistent with a structural process on the right involving gray and white
matter.  No epileptiform features were noted at this time

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.  There was a technical limitation with the T6 electrode which persisted even after it was fixed by the technician.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 9.5 Hz in frequency and 20-40 microvolts in amplitude best seen in the occipital region which attenuates with eye opening.  In drowsiness there is diffuse rhythmic theta bursts in all the channels.

There is an occasional burst of focal slowing seen in the left frontocentral region.

Hyperventilation was performed which showed a diffuse slowing of the record and increase in amplitude.

Photic stimulation showed minimal driving at 13 Hz but no abnormalities.

Heart rate 60 beats per minute.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to occasional bursts of focal slowing on the left frontocentral and frontotemporal regions.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is suggestive of a possible underlying structural abnormality in the left frontocentral and frontotemporal regions.  No epileptiform discharges were identified.  A more prolonged EEG recording may be more helpful to identify spikes or sharp waves.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using the standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This is a technically limited study due to muscle artifact in most of the recording.  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 8-8.5 Hz in frequency noted for a short period of time in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is 6-7 Hz diffuse theta activity seen during wakefulness.  There is generalized low amplitude beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Stage 1 sleep is characterized by disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm and slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact, as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves.  Stage 2 sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in no driving response.  Hyperventilation was associated with slowing of the background activity.  Heart rate was 80 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a technically limited EEG due to a muscle artifact in most of this recording.  This is an abnormal EEG due to slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm and background activity during wakefulness and sleep.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm and background activity are suggestive of cerebral dysfunction due to toxic, metabolic, infectious, or degenerative disorders.  The generalized beta activity could be due to medication effect including benzodiazepine, barbiturate, or could be due to anxiety or hypothyroidisms.  No epileptiform abnormalities were seen in this record.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  A repeat EEG is recommended due to technically limited recording.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan, famotidine, Lovenox, topiramate, Flagyl, Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement with the addition of anterior temporal single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software in addition to nurse's notes were used to review the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm and frontocentral beta.  Overall, there are theta delta mixed frequencies intermingled with multiple multifocal spikes which I will describe in Abnormal Discharges.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Multifocal spikes seen at O1, O2, T6, Fp1, Fp2, T3, and P4.  However, the spikes are mainly seen at O1 and O2 and Fp1/Fp2.
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen almost continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  During the record, there are multiple seizures which in the EEG appear to begin suddenly and display rhythmic, sharply contoured theta intermixed with beta that at times appears to be maximal frontally and then centrally with an overlying rhythmic occipital sharp focus.  The maximal focus or origin of the seizure is unclear.  It is also atypical as it does not appear to evolve as it suddenly starts, remains in the EEG at almost this irregular but continuous frequency, and then appears to slowly dissipate.  During these discharges, the patient appears to move her head side to side and sometimes moves her arms in a wild fashion.  On 1 occasion, her mouth appeared to twitch in the video.  The duration of these episodes can be anywhere from 1 or 2 minutes to prolonged 38-minute seizure.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to multiple seizures with unclear origin and multifocal spikes.

However, due to technical difficulties only 5 hours could be reviewed.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  39-year-old woman with episode of bilateral arm stiffness and gaze deviated to the right.  Has 4-5 seizures in the past month, screaming, with a history of Lennox-Gastaut, mental retardation.  Follow-up EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan, famotidine, Lovenox, topiramate, Flagyl, Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement with the addition of anterior temporal single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software in addition to nurse's notes were used to review the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm and frontocentral beta.  Overall, there are theta delta mixed frequencies intermingled with multiple multifocal spikes which I will describe in Abnormal Discharges.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Multifocal spikes seen at O1, O2, T6, Fp1, Fp2, T3, and P4.  However, the spikes are mainly seen at O1 and O2 and Fp1/Fp2.
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen almost continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  During the record, there are multiple seizures which in the EEG appear to begin suddenly and display rhythmic, sharply contoured theta intermixed with beta that at times appears to be maximal frontally and then centrally with an overlying rhythmic occipital sharp focus.  The maximal focus or origin of the seizure is unclear.  It is also atypical as it does not appear to evolve as it suddenly starts, remains in the EEG at almost this irregular but continuous frequency, and then appears to slowly dissipate.  During these discharges, the patient appears to move her head side to side and sometimes moves her arms in a wild fashion.  On 1 occasion, her mouth appeared to twitch in the video.  The duration of these episodes can be anywhere from 1 or 2 minutes to prolonged 38-minute seizure.

INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection as well as seizure detection software was used to review the events.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  At 11:22:17 a.m., there is a seizure onset at 9-10 Hz alpha activity, maximum in left occipital region (01) with spread to left posterior quadrant and right occipital region, after 20 seconds seizure activity continues as 4-5 Hz theta activity maximum in left posterior quadrant for 40 seconds.  This activity was followed by sharply contoured delta activity with bihemispheric distribution for 90 seconds.  It was followed by postictal attenuation noted in bihemispheric region.  Clinically, patient did not show shaking or jerking, but per video patient seemed less responsive with eyes closed.  Towards the end of this recording, there were left periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges noted in left posterior quadrant region lasting for several minutes with no evolution. There was almost continuous left posterior quadrant slowing almost continuous noted during this recording.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to;

CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to standard the 10-20  system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  During maximal wakefulness the posterior dominant rhythm consists of 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  Fast alpha variant is occasionally observed.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), 2 to 3 second bursts of diffuse sharply contoured theta activity, symmetrical sleep spindles and vertex waves are noted.  Hyperventilation is performed with   poor effort and does not result in significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation does not result in significant change in the background.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an alpha rhythm of 8 to 8.3 Hz.  Most typically when the patient is maximally awake, the EEG is well organized with 8 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta.  In hyperventilation and following hyperventilation there are rare bursts of slowing in the temporal regions as the patient becomes drowsy.  Vertex waves are noted in stage I sleep.  The patient transitions in and out of stage I sleep and there is a slight asymmetry with slight disruption of faster frequency activity noted just in the transition in and out of sleep on the right.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting and out of stage II sleep, and results in scan driving.
Heart rate 84 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Shifting slowing in drowsiness and in the transition to stage II sleep, out of the acceptable range of normal for an adult of this age.
Slight focality with disruption of faster frequency activity on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The slowing of the alpha rhythm is a nonspecific finding, but supports an organic cause for this patient's clinical complaints.  Slowing of the alpha rhythm is a nonspecific finding, but can be seen in dementia, as well as a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.  The subtle focal features described above may be correlated with imaging.

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and


photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically


with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep 1 hour EEG.  There are no


clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep 1 hour EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 38-year-old man who presents with a new onset seizure lasting approximately 10 minutes.  There was associated tongue biting and loss of consciousness.  Of note, the patient was noted to have seizure activity approximately 20 to 30 minutes prior to this EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Dilantin, Norvasc, and hydralazine.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic moderate amplitude 9 to 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  The anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient is weak.  Additional diffuse polymorphic theta activity is present.  Diffuse excess beta is captured, as well.  During sleep, the background attenuates and symmetrical sleep spindles are captured.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a heart rate up to 120 beats a minute.
FINDINGS:
Mild diffuse slowing.
Excess beta.
Stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
Sinus tachycardia.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and asleep 24-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing.  This finding indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction that in this case could partially be related to an excessively sedated/drowsy patient.  Excess beta could be secondary to medication effect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Sinus tachycardia with a heart rate up to 120 beats a minute is captured in a single EKG lead.

She has episodes of losing time between 5 minutes to 2 hours.
MEDICATIONS:  Hydralazine, metoprolol, Neurontin, lovastatin, insulin, oxycodone, and amitriptyline.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG monitoring was performed in the EMU using the standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  An automated seizure and spike detection system and a patient activated alarm system were used.  Records were reviewed daily for EEG abnormalities and clinical events.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Interictal EEG from 08/12/2013 to 08/15/2013:  In the most alert state, there is a posterior dominant rhythm with frequency of 8.5-10.5 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is presence of frontal central low amplitude beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  A stage I sleep was characterized by disappearance of alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of eye blink and muscle artifact, as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves.  Stage II sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  Slow-wave sleep and REM sleep were also captured.  Focal slow waves seen rarely at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolt.
Clinical events:  On 08/14/2013 at 05:37 a.m., there was a push button event as the patient experienced 1 episode of missing time, slurred speech, disorientation.  There were no EEG ictal changes associated with this event.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG monitoring study due to rare left focal slowing at F7/T3.  Patient had 1 event as described above during this recording while she was awake and reports 1 episode of missing time with disorientation.  This event was associated with no ictal change on EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Focal slowing could be due to structural or functional dysfunction of underlying brain in the subcortical white matter in the left hemisphere.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  Patient had 1 event of missing time and disorientation for a few minutes with no EEG correlations.  This is one of the typical event that patient experiences as a seizure activity.  The capturing of missing time and confusion without any associated ictal change on EEG may be suggestive of a simple partial seizure since simple partial seizures are not always captured on scalp EEG or it could be suggestive of a nonepileptic event.  This EEG monitoring does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy since all of the patient's habitual events have not been captured.  If seizure remain a clinical concern, a repeat video EEG monitoring may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software along the patient's alarm events as well as nurses notes were used to review the EEG.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
EVENTS:  The patient had 3 events during the admission.  The first one occurred at 7:00 p.m. after the doctor asked her to raise and lower her hands, and breathe heavily.  The patient started complaining of a headache, later ringing in the ears and became unresponsive with the eyes twitching and rolling backwards with forced eye closure, and some trembling.  The patient also had complaints of some right-sided numbness before the episode started.  The patient remained unresponsive to verbal motor commands until about 7:06:28 p.m.  She had a second event at 8:53:40 p.m. with a similar presentation of eyes rolling back and becoming unresponsive to verbal commands, and then trembling lasting until 8:58 p.m.  At the end she cried just as she did in the first event.  Then she had a third event occurring at 9:53:08 p.m. lasting until 9:58:47 p.m. again with eye fluttering,  trembling and following commands, and afterwards crying.  During all 3 events even though the last 1 there was some substantial electrode artifact and muscle artifact there was no clear EEG changes.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and sleep EEG.  The 3 episodes which were described above had no EEG correlate and clinically appeared to be consistent with her typical spells.  The lack of any EEG abnormalities during the event is diagnostic of a psychogenic nonepileptic event.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a somewhat unusual background.  There are sections of the record with some 5-6 Hz posteriorly predominant activity with a 9 Hz mu rhythm.  The posterior dominant activity is slow, notched, and somewhat regular, suggesting that there may be an underlying somewhat irregular alpha subharmonic.  Prominent lambda confounds this picture.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.  The somewhat notched posterior predominant pattern is seen when the patient is awake, as well as she starts to drift into drowsiness.
Hyperventilation seems to accentuate underlying, posteriorly predominant slowing.
Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response.
Heart rate:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This must be considered an abnormal EEG due to:  Somewhat slow irregular theta frequency activity in the posterior regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Harmonic since subharmonics are normal findings, but there is clearly irregular posteriorly predominant theta that cannot be considered a normal variant.  This EEG differs from a previous EEG on January 4, 2013 which was a normal routine study.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with addition of anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness only.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal swelling seen intermittently at C3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
EPISODES:  During this recording the patient had an episode where she suddenly became unresponsive and her face on the right appeared to look slightly drooped.  She would not follow commands but would response to painful stimuli and at 1 point would answer questions.  Mainly she remains with her eyes closed and her right face appeared slightly drooped.  However, if they stimulated her, her eyes would open and she remained with a right facial droop except when talking.  This episode lasted about 4 minutes after which the patient started responding and then she started shaking her head again in a back-and-forth high-frequency motion, again appeared to be unresponsive, lasted for 30 seconds, stopped, and started again, and she was responsive in between.

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta


activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: deferred



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which

is a normal finding.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no


clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  If epilepsy is


an important concern, consider sleep deprived EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of


epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  Patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedure included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is mild excessive beta seen diffusely.  the patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges which included only photic stimulation.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen at F8/F4 while in wakefulness and sleep.
Focal slow waves seen at F8/F4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.  There is an increased amplitude and presence of faster frequencies consistent with a breach rhythm in that region.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  Eighty-four.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to right frontal slowing and sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of  localization-related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the right frontal region.  In addition, there is evidence focal cerebral dysfunction in the right frontal region consistent with the known surgery.   No seizures were seen.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan, fentanyl, midazolam.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient had noted to have been agitated, yelling, and cursing when awake and had been sedated for the study.  The patient is wearing a hard collar.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with impedances under 5 kilos with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a continuous, relatively low voltage pattern.  Despite the sedation, intermittent arousals were noted with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm followed by more of a beta state with a lower voltage beta pattern and then a transition to stage 2 sleep with spindles and POSTS.
The technologist stimulates the patient and the patient arouses briefly with a 7 Hz background and a glimpse of a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.
Heart rate:  90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG primarily in sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  With arousals, a normal awake pattern was noted.  The pattern described above is compatible with pharmacologic sedation.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing when the patient is out of the ICU and able to cooperate is suggested.

INTRODUCTION:  This is 1-hour digital video EEG performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG opens to posterior dominant rhythm at 10 Hz with mid temporal delta activity at times and 7 Hz theta activity in the background.  Of note, there is left temporal sharp waves during a sleep that is out of criteria for normal variant.  In a stage I and a stage II of a sleep, the temporal sharp waves are more prominent especially on the left side.  These sharp waves can potentially be epileptogenic.  There is also prominent hypersynchronous theta activity and thorough sharp waves in transition from stage I and stage II of sleep, which again are out of proportion for normal variant.  At times, there is hypnagogic hypersynchronous activity seen.

Seizures previously described as tonic-clonic seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Pentasa, methotrexate, Celexa, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Impedances were acceptable, although T1 and T2 electrodes slightly greater than 5 kohms.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a low voltage, 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  In the initial sections of the record there is frequent eye blink, but there is also a subtle area of sharply contoured slowing in the right mid temporal region at T2 and T4.  Hyperventilation is performed slightly after this finding is noted and produces an increase in amplitude, an increase in beta and does not clearly accentuate this finding which is noted again as the patient becomes drowsy with slow rolling eye movements.  This subtle lower voltage focal slowing in the right mid to posterior temporal region has almost a periodicity and when there is some overlying alpha frequency activity there is appearance of a low voltage sharp but without an after going slow wave.  It persisted into drowsiness with an increase in beta but deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
The patient was relatively drowsy during photic stimulation which did elicit a driving response.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to right mid to posterior temporal focal slowing at times sharply contoured with a frequency of approximately 4 Hz.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are very similar to the previous study 05/13/2013.  There is a slight periodicity of the focal slowing.  These findings contrast to previous EEGs in childhood which are reported to have demonstrated generalized spike and wave activity.  But these findings were similar on the previous study and therefore are not likely to have been associated with the car accident and concussion.

INTRODUCTION:  Routine 21-channel EEG was performed utilizing the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement along with hyperventilation and photic stimulation EKG and EOG monitoring.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The white cresting background reveals a large amount of 50-70 microvolt amplitude posterior alpha rhythm with a large amount of 18-30 Hz low voltage of her frontocentral regions.  Large amount of eye blink artifacts were seen throughout much of the waking record.  Moderate amount of muscle artifact was also seen.  With eye opening, there was attenuation of alpha activity.  Periods of drowsiness were seen with attenuation of posterior rhythmic activity and increased slow to medium amount due to symmetric irregular slowing.  Hyperventilation for 3 minutes produced mild increased low to medium amounts.  Bilateral delta and theta frequency slowing.  Photic stimulation was accompanied by symmetric occipital driving.

He was given Narcan, now intubated, now presenting with myoclonus versus seizures.

MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, propofol drip, Versed drip, Ativan, vecuronium was given during the recording.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with Additional anterior temporal single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm.  The background consists of diffuse beta superimposed over what appears to be delta slowing.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.

Abnormal discharges:
1. Frontal predominant occasional spike and wave discharges which at times with stimulation progressed to frontal central predominant spike and wave discharges with a clinical correlate of muscle twitching and jerking consistent with myoclonus.  These are more severe with focal or stimulation.
2. Generalized slow waves with intermixed beta seen diffusely.
Heart rate: 108.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to myoclonus with an EEG correlate of frontal centrally predominant spike and wave, in addition to generalized slowing and excessive beta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  The clinical myoclonus had an EEG correlate and the underlying etiology of this discharge is unclear.  It may be seen in generalized or diffuse cortical injury, such as hypoxia, hypoglycemia, or medication induced, rarely this is seen in the setting of underlying epilepsy.  No other clear seizures were seen.  This was informed to the primary team as the EEG was performed.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode
placement with 1 channel EKG. Impedances were acceptable aside from the T1-T2 electrodes.
Electrode placement was perhaps suboptimal due to some or the features of the vertex waves.
DESCRIPTION OF THE As the tracing begins, the patient is asleep. Features of stage 1 and
stage 2 sleep are noted with vertex activity and spindles. Intermittent bursts of delta were noted. There
is prominent beta. There is a slight asymmetry noted with a bit of slowing noted on the left with a bit more
delta on the left relative to the right Eye movement and EKG artifacts as well were noted 10 the
background.

Hyperventilation was performed early in the record. Hyperventilation clearly accentuates focal slowing
from the left hemisphere, and in hyperventilation, discrete left temporal sharp waves emerge. As the
hyperventilation concludes, the patient drifts off back to sleep with generous beta and again focal slowing
noted from the left. In more prolonged stage II sleep, some of the vertex waves and spindles are slightly
asymmetric. Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting off to sleep. II does not
significantly activate the record, but the focal sharp waves and focal slowing persist In sleep, there are
some lower voltage, discreet bilateral spikes noted with a bit of a field to the left.
At the close of the record, the patient is transitioning back into stage II sleep, but limited wakefulness was
identified with a symmetric brief posterior dominant rhythm.
Heart rate 60 bpm.

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
rare focal slowing in the right centrotemporal region



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) produces
slightly asymmetric driving, more prominent on the right.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a mildly abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to subtle focal slowing in the right
centrotemporal region. There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is the fourth EEG for this patient.  The two studies this year have not identified epileptiform
activity.  The studies from the previous years are not available for comparison.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a technically acceptable EEG, although T1-T2 electrodes had impedances greater than 5 kilo-ohms.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with abundant vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and posts noted in stage II sleep.
Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was falling off to sleep and did not significantly activate the record.
Of note, although most of the vertex waves and K complexes are symmetric, there are rare waveforms which have a slight asymmetry and are slightly maximum in terms of the field on the right, although the phase reversal is at CZ.
IMPRESSION:  This is a subtly abnormal EEG due to:
Slightly asymmetric vertex waves and K complexes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive sharp waves or spikes were noted. This is not a clear example of dyshormia.  If additional information is needed to characterize his epilepsy, a more prolonged study may be obtained.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine 20 minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically acceptable record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is acceptably organized, but there are some sections in maximal wakefulness when it is not and there is excess theta.  There is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which was sometimes disrupted on the left.  Intermittent rhythmic left temporal theta was noted with TIRDA.  This seems to be augmented high hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.
Photic stimulation did elicit a driving response despite the focal features described above.  Hyperventilation seems to accentuate the left temporal slowing.  Brief stage I and stage II sleep include vertex waves and spindles.
In addition to the epileptiform activity identified on the left, there is a single right rhythmic sharp wave
Heart rate:  55 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  This EEG demonstrates a bihemispheric process given the background disorganization.  The predominant activity is on the left including rhythmic slowing on the left and the vast majority of epileptiform activity is on the left.

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed
by symmetric vertex waves and POSTs.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  This was a technically acceptable routine 22-minute EEG with the exception of T1, T2 electrodes where impedances were slightly higher.  The patient was noted to have a prominent breach rhythm on the right.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there was an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm reaching 50-60 microvolts in amplitude.  There is a small amount of background theta and a small amount of underlying slowing noted in the record, a bit more so on the right hemisphere and a bit more so in the posterior regions bilaterally.  The breach rhythm was not as prominent as 1 might expect, although it could be seen with higher amplitude on the right.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in synchronicity in the background.  Frontal beta becomes a bit more prominent in drowsiness, but deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
Photic stimulation did elicit a driving response.

IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG due:
Mild degree of background slowing.
Anticipated focal findings with a bit more focal slowing in the right hemisphere.

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 1,500 mg








SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




Patient remains awake throughout the recording.




Mild underriding diffuse theta activity is seen.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Several low amplitude generalized frontally predominant spikes with aftergoing slow waves are
captured.  Their frequency increases during photic stimulation.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) produces bursts
of generalized irregular spike-and-wave and polyspike-and-wave discharges, lasting up to 9 seconds
(photoparoxysmal response).  This response is most pronounced at 5, 7, 9 fps.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.




HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

(1) very mild diffuse slowing

(2) several generalized frontally predominant spikes and wave complexes


(3) robust photoparoxysmal response



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are consistent with patient's known diagnosis of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.


Mild diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.

Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left frontal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.   Multiple frequent (-19) electrographic seizures were recorded beginning with rhythmic 1-2 Hz sharp waves in the F3 region and evolving into 5-7 Hz polyspike activity then slowing down. They remain mainly at F3 with some F7 spread. They last form 11sec to  1.5 minutes. There was no clinical correlate associated to this EEG activity documented on video.  Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) and polyspikes are also intermittently present in the F3 region at a rate of 1-2 Hz.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed. HR was 72
Summary of Findings:
Status epilepticus, electrographic, left frontal
PLEDs (periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges),frequent, left frontal Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left diffuse
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of electrographic status epilepticus with multiple seizures arising from the left frontal region. In addition there is evidence of focal structural dysfunction and irritability in this region, which is consistent with the known lesion in the region. Lastly there is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is non-specific with regards to etiology.

Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no clear PDR or AP gradient while the patient is awake. The awake background consists of a mixture of a low amplitude beta>theta activity with theta activity most pronounced over the left frontotemporal region. As the recording progresses, the background becomes more attenuated- this corresponds to initiation  of phenobarbital. Additional underriding fast activity is captured over the left anterior quadrant. Diffuse excess beta activity is seen. Continuous high amplitude rhythmic and semi­ rhythmic (PLEDs and quasi-PLEDs) up to 1 Hz sharp waves with aftergoing slow waves emanate from
the left anterior quadrant, most prominent over the F3 lead. Starting at -8:27 AM, intermittent left anterior quadrant seizures appear. They last - 25-60 seconds and have no clinical correlate. They occur at variable frequency throughout the recording, up to multiple times per hour (between 4-5 PM), ie, frank focal status epilepticus. Last clear seizure is captured at -2:07 AM. Electrographically, seizures start with rhythmic left anterior delta- theta activity that rapidly increases in amplitude and rhythmicity, decreases in frequency and spreads throughout the left hemisphere. Periods of brief background discontinuity and sleep-spindle-like waveforms (more visible over the left) are seen during sleep.

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL continuous video -24 hour EEG due to continuous left anterior periodic and semi periodic epileptiform discharges (PLEDs and quasi-PLEDs), left anterior quadrant focal seizures and brief focal status epilepticus, left anterior focal slowing and diffuse slowing . There is a focal structural epileptogenic lesion in the left anterior quadrant.  Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific. Breach rhythm is secondary to the skull defect. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
These findings were conveyed to the primary team and medication regimen was adjusted (phenobarbital was added).

Patient had recurrent seizures, 1-2 days prior to admission with 2 seizures, and then 3 seizures on the day of admission with 1 hour postictal confusion.  The patient is on the 4th floor.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was performed.  Photic stimulation was not completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG was somewhat slow and disorganized.  With a posterior dominant rhythm of 7 Hz, intermittent background theta was noted.  As the recording continues, the patient was stimulated and briefly a 9 Hz alpha rhythm emerges.  Hyperventilation was performed with good effort, serving to alert the patient, and a more normal pattern was identified.  Following hyperventilation, the patient drifts off into drowsiness.  There is a bit of irregular slowing in the right hemisphere particularly centrotemporal and centroparietal.
Posts were noted in stage 1 sleep.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging bedside record with some impedances greater than 5 kilohms, but abnormal due to paroxysmal slowing and apparent wakefulness in the context of a patient who seemed to be quite drowsy.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were subtle focal features noted only on 1 section in this bedside record.  These findings may be correlated with imaging.  The background slowing is a nonspecific finding, but this paroxysmal pattern can be seen in a postictal pattern or in the context of a toxic or metabolic pattern.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.  The

patient was drowsy or asleep for most of the record.


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically


with eye opening.  When drowsy, the alpha slows to 7 Hz.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  Patient has EOMS

in stage II sleep.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

This is a 42 y.o. left handed female admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG)
monitoring with a history of: paroxysmal events of unclear etiology.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;






- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


(9) there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is
not a ""low risk"" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Additionally, T1, F9, T9, P9, T2, F10, T10, and P10 electrodes were placed in this patient.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 8 hours each day the
patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in person or on call 24
hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with
special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a technician was not
available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed
seizure testing and electrode maintenance.





The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named ""Stellate"") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:



INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patients interictal findings were normal, with a posterior dominant
rhythm consisting of low voltage fast frequencies, without any focal findings or epileptiform
discharges.



ICTAL FINDINGS:


The patient had 2 clinical events that were representative of her typical habitual events at home.
They were semiologically and electrographically consistent with nonepileptic behavioral events.
Two additional clinical events of  ""dizziness with right sided numbness"" also had no electrographic
correlate, and also consistent with nonepileptic events.




SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. Nonepileptic behavioral events



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Nonepileptic behavioral events



CONCLUSION:

The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 5 days with continuous video EEG.  This
was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of events.



The interictal EEG is normal.








The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of his admission. As the EEG remained normal
without focal features or epileptiform discharges, the patient was counseled about the diagnosis of
nonepileptic behavioral events and that Keppra is not indicated to treat these.  She is to continue off
Keppra.




We recommend that she to see a psychiatrist or therapist for assessment of underlying
psychopathology and diagnosis.

This is a 42 y.o. left handed female admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG)
monitoring with a history of: paroxysmal events of unclear etiology.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;






- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


(9) there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is
not a ""low risk"" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Additionally, T1, F9, T9, P9, T2, F10, T10, and P10 electrodes were placed in this patient.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 8 hours each day the
patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in person or on call 24
hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with
special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a technician was not
available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed
seizure testing and electrode maintenance.





The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named ""Stellate"") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is
characterized by a posterior dominant rhythm consisting of low voltage fast frequencies.  Lambda
waves are seen in wakefulness.








During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric POSTS, vertex
waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes.



No generalized slowing is present. No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed



EVENTS:

The daytime technician told the rounding team that ""around 2 am"" on 6/15 the patient got out of
bed to use the bathroom and reported dizziness and right sided numbness.  The entire record was
reviewed, end-to-end, with particular attention to arousals from 01:45-03:00.  The patient remained
asleep with normal background.




HEART RATE:


A heart rate in the 80s is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep video EEG. There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG. A posterior dominant rhythm consisting of low
voltage fast frequencies can be a normal variant in the adult population.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.




DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Normal study.

Episode that was reported around 2 am on 6/15/2016 has no EEG correlate.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a posterior dominant rhythm consisting of low voltage fast frequencies.  Lambda
waves are seen in wakefulness.








During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric POSTS, vertex
waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed



EVENTS:

The daytime technician told the rounding team that ""around 2 am"" on 6/15 the patient got out of
bed to use the bathroom and reported dizziness and right sided numbness.  The entire record was
reviewed, end-to-end, with particular attention to arousals from 01:45-03:00.  The patient remained
asleep with normal background.




HEART RATE:


A heart rate in the 80s is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep video EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG. A posterior dominant rhythm consisting of low
voltage fast frequencies can be a normal variant in the adult population.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.




DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Normal study.

Episode that was reported around 2 am on 6/15/2016 has no EEG correlate.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:



INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patients interictal findings were normal, with a posterior dominant
rhythm consisting of low voltage fast frequencies, without any focal findings or epileptiform
discharges.



ICTAL FINDINGS:


The patient had 2 clinical events that were representative of her typical habitual events at home.
They were semiologically and electrographically consistent with nonepileptic behavioral events.
Two additional clinical events of  ""dizziness with right sided numbness"" also had no electrographic
correlate, and also consistent with nonepileptic events.




SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. Nonepileptic behavioral events



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Nonepileptic behavioral events



CONCLUSION:

The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 5 days with continuous video EEG.  This
was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of events.



The interictal EEG is normal.








The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of his admission. As the EEG remained normal
without focal features or epileptiform discharges, the patient was counseled about the diagnosis of
nonepileptic behavioral events and that Keppra is not indicated to treat these.  She is to continue off
Keppra.




We recommend that she to see a psychiatrist or therapist for assessment of underlying
psychopathology and diagnosis.

This is a 42 y.o. left handed female admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG)
monitoring with a history of: paroxysmal events of unclear etiology.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;






- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


(9) there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is
not a ""low risk"" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Additionally, T1, F9, T9, P9, T2, F10, T10, and P10 electrodes were placed in this patient.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 8 hours each day the
patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in person or on call 24
hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with
special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a technician was not
available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed
seizure testing and electrode maintenance.





The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named ""Stellate"") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 8 hours each day the
patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in person or on call 24
hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with
special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a technician was not
available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed
seizure testing and electrode maintenance.





The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named ""Stellate"") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is
characterized by a posterior dominant rhythm consisting of low voltage fast frequencies.  Lambda
waves are seen in wakefulness.








During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric POSTS, vertex
waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes.



No generalized slowing is present. No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed



EVENTS:

The daytime technician told the rounding team that ""around 2 am"" on 6/15 the patient got out of
bed to use the bathroom and reported dizziness and right sided numbness.  The entire record was
reviewed, end-to-end, with particular attention to arousals from 01:45-03:00.  The patient remained
asleep with normal background.




HEART RATE:


A heart rate in the 80s is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep video EEG. There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG. A posterior dominant rhythm consisting of low
voltage fast frequencies can be a normal variant in the adult population.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.




DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Normal study.

Episode that was reported around 2 am on 6/15/2016 has no EEG correlate.

does not answer, but isolated body jerks become more frequent. Tech presses button. Body jerking,
now side-to-side, becomes higher in amplitude. Eyes are closed. Patient does not follow commands.
At 11:10, jerks increase in amplitude to become rhythmic shaking with side-to-side head movements,
which gradually decrease in frequency, become lower in amplitude, and become irregular at offset.
Patient has urinary incontinence and postictal confusion.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:



INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patients interictal findings were normal, with a posterior dominant
rhythm consisting of low voltage fast frequencies, without any focal findings or epileptiform
discharges.



ICTAL FINDINGS:


The patient had 2 clinical events that were representative of her typical habitual events at home.
They were semiologically and electrographically consistent with nonepileptic behavioral events.
Two additional clinical events of  ""dizziness with right sided numbness"" also had no electrographic
correlate, and also consistent with nonepileptic events.




SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. Nonepileptic behavioral events



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Nonepileptic behavioral events



CONCLUSION:

The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 5 days with continuous video EEG.  This
was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of events.



The interictal EEG is normal.








The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of his admission. As the EEG remained normal
without focal features or epileptiform discharges, the patient was counseled about the diagnosis of
nonepileptic behavioral events and that Keppra is not indicated to treat these.  She is to continue off
Keppra.




We recommend that she to see a psychiatrist or therapist for assessment of underlying
psychopathology and diagnosis.

This is a 42 y.o. left handed female admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG)
monitoring with a history of: paroxysmal events of unclear etiology.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;






- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


(9) there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is
not a ""low risk"" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Additionally, T1, F9, T9, P9, T2, F10, T10, and P10 electrodes were placed in this patient.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 8 hours each day the
patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in person or on call 24
hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with
special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a technician was not
available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed
seizure testing and electrode maintenance.





The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named ""Stellate"") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:



INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patients interictal findings were normal, with a posterior dominant
rhythm consisting of low voltage fast frequencies, without any focal findings or epileptiform
discharges.



ICTAL FINDINGS:


The patient had 2 clinical events that were representative of her typical habitual events at home.
They were semiologically and electrographically consistent with nonepileptic behavioral events.
Two additional clinical events of  ""dizziness with right sided numbness"" also had no electrographic
correlate, and also consistent with nonepileptic events.




SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. Nonepileptic behavioral events



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Nonepileptic behavioral events



CONCLUSION:

The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 5 days with continuous video EEG.  This
was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of events.



The interictal EEG is normal.








The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of his admission. As the EEG remained normal
without focal features or epileptiform discharges, the patient was counseled about the diagnosis of
nonepileptic behavioral events and that Keppra is not indicated to treat these.  She is to continue off
Keppra.




We recommend that she to see a psychiatrist or therapist for assessment of underlying
psychopathology and diagnosis.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  A 1-hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was quite somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the overall EEG is low voltage with generous beta.  Scant alpha rhythm was identified.  In this low voltage record, in hyperventilation and drowsiness, there is a subtle, low voltage infrequent somewhat irregular, left temporal slowing.  In addition, there are rare bursts of focal slowing from the right temporal region noted following hyperventilation.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta, followed by vertex waves and K complexes, as well as spindles.
Notable findings in this record include a brief burst of slower, rhythmic 3 hertz delta activity from the left temporal region.  This is followed by a single, low voltage, left temporal sharp waves.  These findings are best visualized in an average reference.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Hyperventilation as described above.  Heart rate slightly irregular 90bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a subtly abnormal EEG due to:
A single, well demarcated burst of rhythmic left temporal slowing.
Very infrequent bursts of shifting lower voltage, temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Only, a single sharp wave was noted in this record.  In this particular clinical context, however, the single sharp waves may be considered as part of this patient's pathology.  No well-defined, higher amplitude spike and slow wave and sharp and slow wave complexes were noted.

MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage 2 sleep record.  It was technically acceptable.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive.  In early drowsiness, the background EEG demonstrates background slowing with slowing of the alpha rhythm, a small degree of disorganization and background theta.  Vertex waves, spindles, and posts were noted in stage 2 sleep.
Hyperventilation was performed with good effort producing some background rhythmic slowing.  Photic stimulation was remarkable for eye movement artifact, but no significant pathology.
Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  This is the 2nd normal EEG at this institution.

49 y.o. female with a history of multiple daily seizures which are
uncontrolled, referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Valproic acid, Topamax, Ativan


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background during early portions of the tracing demonstrated a large amount of
generalized beta activity, muscle and eye blink artifact along with moderate amounts of low to
medium amplitude 10-11 Hz posterior rhythmic activity. Soon after the recording started, 4-5/s
rhythmic muscle artifact was seen in left ear reference montages. At about 1:44:05, rhythmic 4-5/s
muscle artifact increased in amplitude and rapidly generalized, associated with increased heart rate
from 75/m to 132/m. Video monitoring demonstrated the patient to have side to side and less
frequent back and forth head movement along with shaking of her upper body, with head slightly
rotated more to the right than left. This activity persisted until about 1:47:50 and then rapidly
subsided, although slight movements of left hand could be seen intermittently on video recording.
During abnormal shaking movements and afterwards, EEG technologist and physician were at the
bedside examining and speaking with the






patient. She had occasional eye opening and closing and slow head nodding in response to
questions, with EEG background demonstrating a mixture of generalized beta activity, muscle
artifact, EKG artifact and frontal eye movement artifact.




Sleep is not captured



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


HEART RATE:


EKG monitor revealed variable heart rate from 75-132 per minute, as detailed above.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal EEG due to an apparent clinical seizure associated with 4-5/s rhythmic muscle
and movement artifact on EEG along with upper body and side to side shaking head movements. No
pathologic spikes or sharp waves were seen in the recording. A subcortical seizure focus which was
not detected on surface EEG is a possible consideration, although nonepileptic pseudoseizure will
need to be excluded with further neurologic evaluation.

INTRODUCTION:  Routine, 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was a technically satisfactory EEG capturing wakefulness and drowsiness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta.  Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited symmetric, bilateral driving.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.

MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  A 30-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient had limited communication skills and a translator was used during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is awake with a 12 hertz alpha rhythm generous, low voltage, frontal central beta.
In wakefulness and early drowsiness, brief bursts of high amplitude, generalized spike and wave activity were noted.  Some of these seem to begin with a burst of fast activity in the occipital regions with a 3-5 Hz spike and wave complex.  The complexes vary in the frequency, many of them are 3 hertz with a polyspike, but the later spikes in the complex are always consistently slower.  Generally, these are frontally predominant spike and wave complexes and those that occur out of drowsiness do not have this beta buzz prior to the spikes.  The patient is noted to have a subtle head bob and sometimes some movement of her legs during the bursts.  She seems to have clinical symptoms with bursts that are 2 seconds in duration.  The bursts are present in wakefulness and early drowsiness.  Hyperventilation may have increase the duration of the spike and wave and polyspike and wave complexes.  In addition, during hyperventilation, there may be a little bit more fast activity.  The patient was otherwise able to answer questions, before and after the discharges.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response.  Spike and wave activity was noted with a 21 hertz discharge, but was not prolonged relative to other sections of the record.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to generalized spike and wave activity with bursts of 3-5 Hz frontally predominant spike and wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The EEG pattern described above is most compatible with generalized mechanism for epilepsy.  The patient's behavior of the head bobbing and sometimes the leg movements are not outside of normal for a absence seizure.

INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 8.5-9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  A clear breach rhythm was noted from the left with higher amplitude alpha on the left in comparison to the right.  There is prominent muscle artifact noted in the left frontal temporal electrodes with fast activity of approximately 35 hertz.  As the patient becomes drowsy, focal slowing is identified in the left mid temporal region.  The patient does not sustain deeper stages of sleep.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving response.  Hyperventilation was deferred.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to
intermittent focal slowing noted in drowsiness from the left temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The breach rhythm identified above is an anticipated finding following craniotomy and is congruent with the previous left cranial surgery.  There is prominent 35 hertz fast activity noted in the left temporalis/ scalp over congruent with the patient's clinical symptoms and he has complaint of an ongoing muscle spasm in that area.

MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Requip, metoprolol, aspirin, Mevacor, Plavix, others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a followup EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements.
Notable in this record, hyperventilation seems to elicit a somewhat asymmetric hyperventilation response with drop out of faster frequency activity on the left compared to the right and a bit of slowing on the left, although there is some movement artifact.  In addition, in drowsiness, the alpha rhythm drops out on the left a little earlier than the right.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
Heart rate irregular, 60-80 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing noted on the left, seen in hyperventilation and in the transition to drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are some technical limitations to this record, but the left focal features appear to be genuine.  The irregular heart rate may be a new finding and the patient's outpatient physician will be contacted.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically acceptable 20-minute EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Tramadol.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Hyperventilation was performed early in the record producing bursts of rhythmic theta.  There is a single, notched, frontal generalized burst noted in the 1st 2 minutes of hyperventilation, but there are no definitive spike and wave complexes noted in hyperventilation.  As the patient became drowsy following hyperventilation, there is an increase in frontal theta.  The patient waxes and wanes in and out of a drowsy state.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
HEART RATE 72 BPM.
There were some shifting asymmetries noted in the hyperventilation response as well.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within the limits of normal.

Description: Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric region. No focal slowing is present.  Frequent focal sharp waves are present with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at P3 and large central field. At times they appear rhythmically in runs for up to 15 seconds.  There were 4 seizures during this record. Lasting from 30 to 55 seconds. Thet start with rhythmic left parietal (P3) sharp waves that increase in frequency and amplitude.The field spreads centrally but remain mainly in the central and parietal region.  She may look initially to the left and seconds later she has right with head version while lifting her right arm, her eyes also jerk to the right. She continues this behavior until she suddenly stops.  She does not follow commands during the event. She is post ictally confused for 1-2 minutes.

Description of pushbutton events
Description: Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric region. No focal slowing is present.  Frequent focal sharp waves are present with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at P3 and large central field. At times they appear rhythmically in runs for up to 15 seconds.  There were 4 seizures during this record. Lasting from 30 to 55 seconds. Thet start with rhythmic left parietal (P3) sharp waves that increase in frequency and amplitude.The field spreads centrally but remain mainly in the central and parietal region.  She may look initially to the left and seconds later she has right with head version while lifting her right arm, her eyes also jerk to the right. She continues this behavior until she suddenly stops.  She does not follow commands during the event. She is post ictally confused for 1-2 minutes.

DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  During the early hours of the record, the background EEG is diffusely slow.  There are intermittent rhythmic bursts of theta noted from the left temporal region, but these do not have clear build up and are not associated with clear change in the patient's level of consciousness.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, the EEG is markedly slow and featureless.
In this section of the record, no clinical seizures were recorded.  Practice push buttons were noted.  The patient had an episode of vocalization without clear clinical correlate.

Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal regions (left more
than right) during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. The focal slow on  the left is at time
sharply countoured.  The right temporal regions at times appears slightly more attenuated when
compared to the left.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Stimulation caused a myogenic
artifact but not a marked change in the background.  Hr was 114
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal
regions (left more than right).  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is postictal, agitated, and had difficulty cooperating.  Impedances were all under 5 kilohms because of this.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG includes generous muscle and generous beta.  There is a glimpse of a 12 Hz alpha rhythm, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is also some lower voltage rhythmic frontal delta noted in wakefulness.  At the very final few minutes of the EEG, the patient starts to drift off to sleep with a lower voltage beta pattern.  In this technically challenging EEG, there is a slight beta asymmetry with a bit more beta noted on the left, relative to the right.
Heart rate 120 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is technically challenging, but abnormal EEG due to:
Excess beta.
Likely some frontal delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Given the limitations of this EEG, focal features may be overlooked and the beta asymmetry is of unclear significance.  To more completely characterize this patient's EEG, a followup study when he is more cooperative is suggested.

MEDICATIONS:  Phenytoin.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a very tense patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there was a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by attenuation of alpha rhythm with slow rolling eye movements.  In drowsiness, the rhythmic theta was slightly asymmetric, slightly more prominent on the right.  Unfortunately, sleep was not sustained.
Hyperventilation produced a small amount of slowing in the frontal regions without definitive asymmetry.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is at the limits of normal in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.

Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events. Differential diagnosis.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.









- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;


- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a ""low risk"" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.





The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named ""Stellate"") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

DAY 1 (7/05/2016, 18:34 - 7/06/2016, 09:00)



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present. No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not
produce any EEG changes.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



DAY 1 IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep only routine EEG. There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.






SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:

Interictal Findings:

None





Ictal Findings:

The patient had no clinical events while hooked up to continuous video EEG monitoring in the
epilepsy monitoring unit.




SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. None



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Possible PNES



CONCLUSION:

 was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 1 day with continuous video EEG.  This
was an inconclusive EMU monitoring session because no events were captured and the patient was
not cooperating with the team.




The patient had a discussion about nonepileptic events and their association with
underlying psychiatric co-morbidities and are not due to abnormal electrical discharges of the
brain/cortex.



We recommend that he/she to see a psychiatrist or therapist for assessment of underlying
psychopathology and diagnosis.

seizures referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal

Events.  The family notes that the patient has screaming spells.

The patient herself is aware of dizzy spells.  History of


cirrhosis splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia.  Dementia with

Montréal cognitive assessment score of 15.



MEDICATIONS:

escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) 5 mg tablet, on hold

omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 20 mg capsule, Take 20 mg by mouth daily.


QUEtiapine (SEROQUEL) 25 mg tablet, Take 25 mg by mouth nightly.

multivitamin (THERAGRAN) per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth

daily.


lactulose (CHRONULAC) 10 gram/15 mL solution, Take 30 g by mouth

3 times daily.

Flagyl


SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


Continuous video EEG monitoring A 21 channel electroencephalogram

(EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG and spike detection software.

Attempts were made to keep the patient out of bed and to keep her


activated were unsuccessful.  Each day, if she was out of bed and

asked to bicycle, she got back in bed.  She typically reported


dizziness on rounds when asked directly, but she never pushed the

button for a dizzy spell.  No episodes of screaming or aggressive

or inappropriate behavior were recorded.

DAY 1 (03/01, - 3/2/2016, 06:00)



AEDs: none


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates


symmetrically with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Intermittent, mild generalized slowing is present. No focal

slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none successful



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.  She reported dizziness between noon and 1 PM.  A


normal awake pattern was noted at this time.  She did not press

the button or report the symptoms to the nurses


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.

Impression:


Though none of the patient's typical spells were captured, this

is a normal 24 hour EEG.  The dizzy spells did not have any EEG

correlate.

IMPRESSION:

This three-day continuous video EEG monitoring session was


unremarkable.  The overall background is within normal limits for

an adult of this age.  Although the patient occasionally endorsed


dizziness, she never pushed the button and review of the EEG at

those times did not identify any abnormalities.  None of her


disruptive behaviors which are current home were elicited.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of


epilepsy.  Careful review of the home situation, for this elderly

woman with dementia, may help explain the screaming spells and

prevent further behaviors.

included a single channel of EKG and spike detection software.

Attempts were made to keep the patient out of bed and to keep her


activated were unsuccessful.  Each day, if she was out of bed and

asked to bicycle, she got back in bed.  She typically reported


dizziness on rounds when asked directly, but she never pushed the

button for a dizzy spell.  No episodes of screaming or aggressive

or inappropriate behavior were recorded.

DAY 1 (03/01, - 3/2/2016, 06:00)



AEDs: none


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates


symmetrically with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Intermittent, mild generalized slowing is present. No focal

slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none successful



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.  She reported dizziness between noon and 1 PM.  A


normal awake pattern was noted at this time.  She did not press

the button or report the symptoms to the nurses


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.

Impression:


Though none of the patient's typical spells were captured, this

is a normal 24 hour EEG.  The dizzy spells did not have any EEG

correlate.

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

FIRDA- drowsiness only



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none successful


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.  Patient behaviors were unremarkable- she prefers to


stay in bed and is inattentive.


HEART RATE:

Impression:

Though none of the patient's typical spells were captured, this


is a normal 24 hour EEG.  FIRDA is a normal finding in the

transition to sleep.


IMPRESSION:

This three-day continuous video EEG monitoring session was


unremarkable.  The overall background is within normal limits for

an adult of this age.  Although the patient occasionally endorsed


dizziness, she never pushed the button and review of the EEG at

those times did not identify any abnormalities.  None of her


disruptive behaviors which are current home were elicited.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of


epilepsy.  Careful review of the home situation, for this elderly

woman with dementia, may help explain the screaming spells and

prevent further behaviors.

Impression:


Though none of the patient's typical spells were captured, this

is a normal 24 hour EEG.  The dizzy spells did not have any EEG

correlate.



DAY 2 (03/02, - 3/3/2016, 06:00)



AEDs: none

EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta


activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5


Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen. FIRDA was seen in the transition to


sleep.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Intermittent, mild generalized slowing is present. No focal

slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none successful



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.  Patient behaviors, such as attempted removal of EEG

electrodes were noted



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


Impression:

Though none of the patient's typical spells were captured, this

is a normal 24 hour EEG.  FIRDA is a normal finding in the

transition to sleep.

wave sleep was not captured.  Likely REM was noted at 02:38 AM



Intermittent, mild generalized slowing is present. No focal

slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

FIRDA- drowsiness only



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none successful


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.  Patient behaviors were unremarkable- she prefers to


stay in bed and is inattentive.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54- 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


Impression:

Though none of the patient's typical spells were captured, this


is a normal 24 hour EEG.  FIRDA is a normal finding in the

transition to sleep.


IMPRESSION:

This three-day continuous video EEG monitoring session was


unremarkable.  The overall background is within normal limits for

an adult of this age.  Although the patient occasionally endorsed


dizziness, she never pushed the button and review of the EEG at

those times did not identify any abnormalities.  None of her


disruptive behaviors which are current home were elicited.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of


epilepsy.  Careful review of the home situation, for this elderly

woman with dementia, may help explain the screaming spells and

prevent further behaviors.

DAY 3 (03/03, - 34/2016, 010:00 AM)



AEDs: none

EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5


Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen. FIRDA was seen in the transition to


sleep.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and. Slow

wave sleep was not captured.  Likely REM was noted at 02:38 AM



Intermittent, mild generalized slowing is present. No focal

slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

FIRDA- drowsiness only



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none successful


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.  Patient behaviors were unremarkable- she prefers to


stay in bed and is inattentive.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54- 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


Impression:

Though none of the patient's typical spells were captured, this


is a normal 24 hour EEG.  FIRDA is a normal finding in the

transition to sleep.


IMPRESSION:

This three-day continuous video EEG monitoring session was


unremarkable.  The overall background is within normal limits for

an adult of this age.  Although the patient occasionally endorsed


dizziness, she never pushed the button and review of the EEG at

those times did not identify any abnormalities.  None of her


disruptive behaviors which are current home were elicited.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of


epilepsy.  Careful review of the home situation, for this elderly

woman with dementia, may help explain the screaming spells and

prevent further behaviors.

HISTORY:

76 y.o. female with a history of possible


seizures referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal

Events.  The family notes that the patient has screaming spells.

The patient herself is aware of dizzy spells.  History of


cirrhosis splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia.  Dementia with

Montréal cognitive assessment score of 15.



MEDICATIONS:

escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) 5 mg tablet, on hold

omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 20 mg capsule, Take 20 mg by mouth daily.


QUEtiapine (SEROQUEL) 25 mg tablet, Take 25 mg by mouth nightly.

multivitamin (THERAGRAN) per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth

daily.


lactulose (CHRONULAC) 10 gram/15 mL solution, Take 30 g by mouth

3 times daily.

Flagyl


SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


Continuous video EEG monitoring A 21 channel electroencephalogram

(EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG and spike detection software.

Attempts were made to keep the patient out of bed and to keep her


activated were unsuccessful.  Each day, if she was out of bed and

asked to bicycle, she got back in bed.  She typically reported


dizziness on rounds when asked directly, but she never pushed the

button for a dizzy spell.  No episodes of screaming or aggressive

or inappropriate behavior were recorded.

Montréal cognitive assessment score of 15.



MEDICATIONS:

escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) 5 mg tablet, on hold

omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 20 mg capsule, Take 20 mg by mouth daily.


QUEtiapine (SEROQUEL) 25 mg tablet, Take 25 mg by mouth nightly.

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


Continuous video EEG monitoring A 21 channel electroencephalogram

(EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG and spike detection software.

Attempts were made to keep the patient out of bed and to keep her


activated were unsuccessful.  Each day, if she was out of bed and

asked to bicycle, she got back in bed.  She typically reported


dizziness on rounds when asked directly, but she never pushed the

button for a dizzy spell.  No episodes of screaming or aggressive

or inappropriate behavior were recorded.

DAY 1 (03/01, - 3/2/2016, 06:00)



AEDs: none


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates


symmetrically with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Intermittent, mild generalized slowing is present. No focal

slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


Continuous video EEG monitoring A 21 channel electroencephalogram

(EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG and spike detection software.

Attempts were made to keep the patient out of bed and to keep her


activated were unsuccessful.  Each day, if she was out of bed and

asked to bicycle, she got back in bed.  She typically reported


dizziness on rounds when asked directly, but she never pushed the

button for a dizzy spell.  No episodes of screaming or aggressive

or inappropriate behavior were recorded.

DAY 1 (03/01, - 3/2/2016, 06:00)



AEDs: none


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates


symmetrically with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Intermittent, mild generalized slowing is present. No focal

slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none successful



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.  She reported dizziness between noon and 1 PM.  A


normal awake pattern was noted at this time.  She did not press

the button or report the symptoms to the nurses


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.

Impression:


Though none of the patient's typical spells were captured, this

is a normal 24 hour EEG.  The dizzy spells did not have any EEG

correlate.

EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is present.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity
is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm
attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 26-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:





A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, hyperventilation, and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of 10-11 Hz rhythmic posterior activity,
higher in amplitude on the right, reactive to eye opening and closing. Low amplitude 18-30 Hz
activity was seen with normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude present.




During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse
background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



A moderate amount of irregular medium amplitude 2-5 Hz slowing was seen over right temporal
regions.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Occasional wicket waves are noted during drowsiness over the right temporal regions



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RHYTHM:

Sinus arrhythmia at 50-60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
systemwith T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKGand photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




Diffuse excess beta activity is captured.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.





HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 59 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events

INTRODUCTION:  One-hour digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This extended study permitted the patient to become somewhat more drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Abundant mu activity was noted.  Rhythmic midtemporal theta of drowsiness was also noted.  In the transition to sleep, there are multiple different patterns, which were identified.  These included hypnagogic hypersynchrony.  In addition to the rhythmic temporal theta with characteristics of 5 hertz morphology, there is a bit of underlying, irregular slowing noted in the temporal regions.
Additionally, when the technologist allowed the record to run a little longer, there are bursts of rhythmic, high amplitude frontal delta, and some of these bursts appear to have an underlying 3-5 Hz spike and wave complex, maximum FZCZ with slight asymmetry, spreading to the right.

Description:
Patient is sedated as the recording opens.  The background is symmetrical and consists of a mixture
of polymorphic frequencies (delta, theta, alpha and beta).  Occasionally the background becomes
discontinuous or frankly burst-suppressed.  These changes are related to adjustments in anesthesia.
Left internal carotid artery is clamped at 6:55 pm and left common carotid artery is clamped ~ 25-
30 seconds later.  Within ~ 15-20 seconds of clamping the left common carotid artery, diffuse
change is seen.  It is more pronounced over the left.  This change is characterized by voltage
attenuation as well as abrupt disappearance of fast frequencies.  The attending surgeon is notified
of these changes immediately and shunt placement takes place.  Simultaneously, there is increase
in the dose of  sevoflurane and prominent diffuse delta activity appears as a result.  The primary
team is informed of these changes.  EEG returns to the pre-clamp baseline b ~ 7:06 PM.  Left
carotid artery is re-clamped at ~ 8:48 PM and EEG changes within ~ 5 seconds.  This change is
characterized by diffuse (left>right) voltage attenuation and dominance of delta activity.  EEG
change persists until ~ 8;55 PM when left internal and common carotid arteries are unclamped.
EEG gradually returns to the pre-clamp baseline.
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL ~4 hour continuous intraoperative EEG due to global (left>right) changes
that were seen after clamp was applied to the left common and internal carotid arteries. However,
by the end of the recording, EEG appeared symmetrical and at pre-clamp baseline.  Total time of
the direct EEG monitoring by the EEG attending: ~ 2 hours.

Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
Patient is sedated as the recording opens.  The background is symmetrical and consists of a mixture
of polymorphic frequencies (delta, theta, alpha and beta).  Occasionally the background becomes
discontinuous or frankly burst-suppressed.  These changes are related to adjustments in anesthesia.
Left internal carotid artery is clamped at 6:55 pm and left common carotid artery is clamped ~ 25-
30 seconds later.  Within ~ 15-20 seconds of clamping the left common carotid artery, diffuse
change is seen.  It is more pronounced over the left.  This change is characterized by voltage
attenuation as well as abrupt disappearance of fast frequencies.  The attending surgeon is notified
of these changes immediately and shunt placement takes place.  Simultaneously, there is increase
in the dose of  sevoflurane and prominent diffuse delta activity appears as a result.  The primary
team is informed of these changes.  EEG returns to the pre-clamp baseline b ~ 7:06 PM.  Left
carotid artery is re-clamped at ~ 8:48 PM and EEG changes within ~ 5 seconds.  This change is
characterized by diffuse (left>right) voltage attenuation and dominance of delta activity.  EEG
change persists until ~ 8;55 PM when left internal and common carotid arteries are unclamped.
EEG gradually returns to the pre-clamp baseline.
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL ~4 hour continuous intraoperative EEG due to global (left>right) changes
that were seen after clamp was applied to the left common and internal carotid arteries. However,
by the end of the recording, EEG appeared symmetrical and at pre-clamp baseline.  Total time of
the direct EEG monitoring by the EEG attending: ~ 2 hours.

Patient subsequently received tramadol for a fracture and had a tonic-clonic seizure.  The patient was started on carbamazepine and since then, complains of feeling spacey.
INTRODUCTION:  One-hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient has received levetiracetam 1000 mg during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the background EEG is diffusely slow with an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm, but with excess beta and bursts of theta.  Bursts of frontally predominant spike and wave activity are noted.  In addition, isolated right or left frontal spike and wave discharges are noted.  Some of these demonstrate a prominence in the right hemisphere.  Hyperventilation was performed early in the record and clearly accentuates frontally predominant spike and wave activity.  The spike and wave activity ranges from 3 to 5 hertz in frequency.   Discharges are not sustained with most spike and wave complexes either isolated or occurring in bursts, less than 1.5 seconds duration.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting off to sleep.  This spike and wave discharges did not seem to be augmented by the photic stimulation, but as the patient transitions to sleep, there was a higher amplitude, frontally predominant slowing with a bit more slow spike and wave activity.  Levetiracetam was given at approximately 12 p.m. and the EEG was recorded until 12:41.  Following the levetiracetam, by 12:30, there did appear to be a decrease in the spike and wave activity.  The paroxysmal slowing was a little less remarkable and while the EEG remained abnormal with excess theta, the overall pattern was improving.  The alpha rhythm was at 8.3 hertz at conclusion.
Heart rate, slightly irregular at 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Initially markedly abnormal background with excess slowing and disorganized pattern, improving towards the close of the record.
Frontally predominant spike and slow wave activity.
Focal spike and slow wave activity with a predominance further on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG may represent a focal or a secondary generalized mechanism for epilepsy.  There was a small degree of irregularity in the heart rate noted in the final pages of the EEG, which may be evaluated by different mechanisms.

EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.

EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with excess of theta activity, and with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz
posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and
amplitude is present but suboptimal.

EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:




This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization


2. Abundant (>1/10s) bursts of occipitally-predominant generalized irregular spike- and polyspike-and-
wave activity, in wake and sleep



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of generalized epileptogenic potentials, or possibly an occipital
focus of irritability with rapid bisynchrony, superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


When compared to this patient's prior routine EEG in 2015, the present study demonstrates increased
prevalence of epileptogenic discharges.

TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present. There is frequent vertical and lateral
eye movement artifact throughout the study.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:






Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with fair cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 20 minute digital video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG)

was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and

photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The patient is asleep throughout most of the EEG.

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.5

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with


synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was  Captured and includes 1-2 Hz


frontal delta > 70 uV,  SWS was not sustained, but recorded at

the end of the record.


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds but the patient fell asleep.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which


is a normal finding.

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 7-8Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Much of the record captures drowsiness or sleep.  There is
diffuse bihemispheric theta (5-6Hz) slowing intermittently throughout the recording even when the
patient is awake.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta
activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During brief stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to vertex 2-4Hz activity.
There is subtle left frontal and temporal predominance of the background slowing.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep due to diffuse bihemispheric slowing and

EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 23 y.o. male with a history of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Keppra




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:








The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.   Fast alpha variant is frequently seen.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is aborted early as per patient's request.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of ~60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  Frequent premature QRS complexes are
captured with the resultant pauses (up to 1 sec long).

EEG BACKGROUND:







As the study begins, patient is awake. The waking background is characterized by the presence of a
symmetric mixture of 4 Hz theta frequencies, with scant reactive 6 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. There is a lot
of muscle and chew artifact and frontal beta.  The patient is demonstrates psychomotor slowing




A burst of frontal fast activity is followed by R temporal ADA and then sharp waves. The discharge
may have started before the EEG began but it is seen  At 10:39. When tested,  the patient has
speech arrest. She received 2 mg Ativan and afterwards, the EEG pattern shifts to symmetric theta,
with prominent delta, and the patient's speech returned.

34 y.o. female with a history of seizures  referred for routine EEG for characterization
of seizures.


Onset October 2015 and in February 2016 had her third. She is in recovery from IV heroin; first
seizure was 6 months clean while she was in jail; she felt an aura and then had a generalized seizure
that she does not recall; second one had been clean had half a bag, overdosed, when got narcan
she seized; was hospitalized for a week at Methodist with a prolonged post-ictal state. Third seizure
she was using but had not that say so she was in withdrawal. She was a daily user, 14 bags a day.
She has had a lot of head trauma in her life




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


gabapentin (NEURONTIN) 300 mg capsule,

metoclopramide (REGLAN) 10 mg tablet,

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) 40 mg tablet,


topiramate (TOPAMAX) 25 mg tablet,

propranolol (INDERAL) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily for 360 days.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV, and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes.  Spiky vertex waves were seen Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
