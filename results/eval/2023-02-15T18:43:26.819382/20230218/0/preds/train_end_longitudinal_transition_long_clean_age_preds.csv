CLINICAL HISTORY: 49-year-old male with a history of seizures since his late 20's.  Head injury at age 13 with coma and concussion.  The patient has 2-3 nocturnal seizures a week.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Depakote.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the alpha rhythm is 8.5 Hz, 30-40 uV. There is a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity. There is a scant amount of theta activity in wakefulness.
Drowsiness is characterized by bitemporal wicket and slow rolling eye movement.  . Hyperventilation  produces  occasional bursts of  right temporal beta.   Photic stimulation  elicits
symmetric driving response.

HR: 72BPM.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right temporal focal slowing in hyperventilation


CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen. A structural or functional abnormality on the right can be considered. To further identify epileptiform activity, a repeat record with sleep is recommended.

INTRODUCTION: Digital Video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF  THE  RECORD: In wakefulness,  there  is  a  10  Hz,  40  uV  posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral  beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized  by slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm with prominent temporal wicket.  This is a bit higher amplitude on the left and there is a very subtle underlying  slow wave underlying some of the wicket from the left.  This same pattern can be seen in hyperventilation as well as in early drowsiness. On one or two occasions, there is a slight asymmetry with a bit more beta in the left frontal  region when compared to the right.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.   Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.

IMPRESSION: Subtly abnormal EEG due to:
1.         An underlying area of focal slowing from the left temporal region underlying  the wicket.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is the fourth EEG for this patient.  None of the EEG's have ever identified epileptiform activity on the left.   The last two EEG's were normal.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz, 30 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  There is some subtle slowing with primarily theta frequency activity picked up in the posterior regions, slightly more so on the left than the right.   Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is a bit more irregularity in the right hemisphere compared to the left.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in rhythmicity of the background, and the subtle focal features previously described are not quite as prominent.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving bilaterally, somewhat more intense on the right.

1.	Subtle irregular slowing in the posteriotemporal regions, right greater than left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  These findings may be correlated with imaging.  There is a slightly more vigorous driving response in the right compared to the left at faster frequencies, raising the possibility of a breach rhythm, although none is reported with examination of the scalp.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 30 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  Hyperventilation does not activate the record.  The major abnormalities occur around the time of photic stimulation.  The tech starts to awaken the patient for photic.  A brief burst lasting just under one second is seen with high amplitude, sharply contoured activity without a really well-defined spike and slow wave complex, but with notched frontal activity.  Reviewing the burst with different montages, it seems to phase reverse slightly to the left.

1 seizure occurred in the EEG lab at 13:51.  This follows photic stimulation, but does not occur during photic stimulation.  The patient is resting quietly with her eyes closed.  As the seizure begins at 13:51:57, no clinical signs or symptoms are noted.  The technologist notes the change in behavior.  The patientÕs eyes open at 13:52:10.  The technologist asks the patient questions at 13:52:16.  The patient opens her eyes and swallows.  When asked where she is she replies that she is in the neurologistÕs office.  She remains somewhat confused in the minutes that follow.  The tech calls the patient at 13:52:39.   At 13:52:46, she sits, staring blankly, and then she starts to rub her eyes in her head.  The tech asks if she is okay.  At this point, when the tech is asking the patient questions, the seizure has ended and the patient is confused.

EEG characteristics of this seizure include the appearance of rhythmic theta frequency activity, which is more remarkable in the posterior regions.  This seizure seems to start with some low voltage fast activity and then some rhythmic theta, more remarkable in the posterior regions and perhaps maximum in the right posterior region.  Reviewing this seizure with a circle montage, seems to confirm a phase reversal in the right occipitotemporal region but also involving the right central region, nearly isoelectric Cz to C4.  The activity shows frequency evolution and seems to occur in two phases with secondary build-up at 13:52:19 with fast activity and more of a generalized appearance.  The activity ends at 13:52:51 as the patient starts to rub her head with postictal slowing.

HR:  96 BPM.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Complex partial seizure, which was difficult to localize and which may have had some generalized features at the start, but with some evidence of focality in the same seizure.
2. An unusual paroxysmal burst frontal in nature.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of an underlying seizure disorder.  There may be more than one contributing factor for this patientÕs seizures.  This EEG did not provide adequate localization for the seizures that this individual experienced.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Previous EEGs are not available for comparison.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in background slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  Of note, there is a single four second burst in photic stimulation where the patient seems to have had eye flutter, but looking at the eyes there is no discernable eye movement, and the activity is in the frontal regions with a somewhat different field of spread in the eye monitor in comparison to the patient’s other eye movements.  This burst is highly suspicious for frontally predominant notched delta as might be seen in generalized spike and slow wave activity.

IMPRESSION: This EEG is abnormal due to:
1.	A single, suspicious, approximately 2 to 3 second burst of notched frontal delta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to this patient’s two previous EEGs, there is much less in the way of epileptiform activity, and the overall background is more consistently normal.  The epileptiform activity in this record was not well defined - really only suspicious underlying sharply contoured activity with the paroxysmal bursts.

CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 37-year-old  woman with seizures  with VNS implantation  in
2003 now with change in seizure type. MEDICATIONS: Topamax and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital  video EEG is performed in the lab using standard  10-20 system of electrode placement  with one channel  of EKG. Hyperventilation  and  photic  stimulation were performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.



DESCRIPTION OF  THE   RECORD: In  wakefulness,  the  background  EEG  is  symmetric,


continuous, and fairly well organized for age.  There is a 9 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant  alpha rhythm,  which  is  attenuated  with  eyes  opened.    There  is  a  small  amount  of  low  voltage, frontocentral  beta  activity.   As the tracing continues,  alternative  sharp  waves  in  the posterior region, as well as 3 Hz spike and slow wave activity were seen in drowsiness.  The 3 Hz activities repeatedly occurred  in drowsiness, lasting from 1 to 3.5 seconds without change in behavior. This activity seemed to emanate from the left central and temporal regions.   No clinical behavior was observed  on  the  video  can1era. Drowsiness  is  characterized  by  a  mixed frequency  of  brain activity,  but deeper stages of sleep  were not achieved.   Hyperventilation  mildly  increased  the slow theta activity on the background.  Post-hyperventilation, the patient became drowsy.  Photic stimulation elicits driving.

ID:  60BPM.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  alternative sharp activity in the posterior region.
2.   3 Hz spike and slow wave activity seen in drowsiness, repeatedly originating  from the left central and temporal areas- C3 and T3 areas.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This abnormal EEG reflects an underlying pathologic process of the brain and provides a partial mechanism for epilepsy in this patient.  The occurrence of 3 Hz spike and slow wave activity is a likely epileptogenic in origin and  bears clinical  significance. However,  the electric  artifact from  the VNS device should be excluded.    A repeat EEG  with careful attention to the VNS device is recommended.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  Early drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the alpha rhythm to 8 Hz.   Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, producing an increase in theta.  Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
There is a single abnormality identified in this record in the transition just as the patient is drifting off to sleep and it does seem to elicit an arousal.  This is a frontally predominant spike and slow wave complex with a poly spike and slow wave component reaching amplitudes up to 200 uV.  It is symmetric and frontally predominant.  The whole entire entity includes a burst of approximately one second without clear correlate, but with an alerting.
HR:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	An isolated, frontally predominant spike and slow wave complex.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In contrast to previous studies, this EEG demonstrated a relative paucity of epileptiform activity.  This may be due to the little sleep that was recorded in this record.  Of note, this patient has a history of prominent spike and slow wave activity in sleep.  The observation of an arousal in association with epileptiform activity may be part of this patient’s underlying sleep disturbance.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz, 30 to 50 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by prominent rhythmic diffuse theta activity particularly in the occipital regions.  Hyperventilation is performed out of drowsiness and seems to accentuate this activity as well.  There are rare bursts of higher amplitude more sharply contoured frontal theta at the close of hyperventilation and there is a single, discrete left anterior temporal sharp wave in the transition from hyperventilation to sleep.  As the patient reaches stage I sleep, there are slow rolling eye movements with attenuation of the alpha rhythm, vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.
Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is relatively asleep with features of stage II sleep identified during photic stimulation.  While there is a low voltage, symmetric brief driving response following photic stimulation as the patient drifts off to sleep, there are two bursts of symmetric, low voltage TFA.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG to due to:
Brief bursts of generalized paroxysmal fast activity identified following photic stimulation in a state of relative drowsiness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is the third EEG for this patient.  The GPFA is similar to abnormalities identified on the October 5, 2000 EEG.  The 1994 EEG was normal, and the 2002 EEG identified some left 5 Hz activity from the occipital scalp region.  The major relevant difference between the two EEGs is the presence of a discrete, left frontal sharp wave.  This has been reported in the literature as part of the maturational process of a primary generalized epilepsy, but it could also be seen in the setting of a partial or focal epilepsy as well.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is 8Hz posterior dominant rhythm.
In hyperventilation and in drowsiness,  however, there is more rhythmic 5Hz background theta with almost a rhythmic 5Hz posterior dominant rhythm.
There are intermittent bursts of frontally predominant generalized spike and wave and polyspike and wave activity. These occur in hyperventilation and are of 3-5 seconds duration. They are seen post hyperventilation in bursts lasting approximately 3 seconds in duration. The last burst is seen at 120 seconds post hyperventilation as the patient transitions into sleep.  Additional bursts are seen in the transition to stage I sleep.  They do not clearly produce an arousal response, although the first burst is seen in the first transition to sleep.  Other features of stage II  sleep include spindles and posts.
Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.   On 1 occasion the spike and wave activity also seems to be associated with the photic stimulation.

There is also some psychomotor variant, which in this case is likely a normal variant.

The patient is not experiencing absence or myoclonic seizures at this time.
MEDICINES:  Lamictal, others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background includes a 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive.  There is generous background beta.  Notable in this record is an occipitally predominant 5 hertz rhythmic discharge.  It is occipitally predominant and has at times almost a spike and wave complex.  It is typically more prominent in the right occipital region than the left, although on occasion, does appear to be a bit more prominent on the left.
The discharge is prominent at the midline with a slight predominance to the left.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation clearly accentuate this discharge.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.
Heart rate:  60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Posteriorly predominant, right greater than left, 5 hertz discharge.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The activity described above is probably an epileptiform variant and may be related to this patient's previous generalized spike and wave discharge.  The activity is more prominent at the midline and just to the right of the midline, although it is sometimes seen on the left. No clinical events were recorded.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with symmetric, reactive 10 Hz, 30 to 50 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. In both hyperventilation and in drowsiness, there is an increase in shifting, right or left temporal theta, as well as some sharply contoured theta frequency activity which reaches higher amplitudes up to 70 V from the right mid-to-anterior temporal region.   Stage II sleep is characterized by symmetric vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.
Photic stimulation elicits symmetric driving, as well as LAMBDA waves.
HR:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1.	The appearance of shifting, right greater than left temporal theta in drowsiness and hyperventilation with higher amplitude, more sharply contoured theta activity from the right identified on one occasion from the temporal regions and on one occasion from the parietal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The features described above are non-specific.  They support a process involving the temporal regions and the right hemisphere more strongly than the left.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The patient experiences a single episode of left leg shaking.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with symmetric, reactive 10 Hz, 25 V posterior dominant rhythm and occasional posterior slow waves of youth.  In the transition to drowsiness, on rare occasions, there is subtle, rhythmic theta activity identified from the left anterior temporal and frontal region.  On one occasion, this activity is also identified in hyperventilation.  Features of stage I sleep include high amplitude vertex waves.
Hyperventilation elicits a rare burst of slowing described above as well as bursts of rhythmic, high amplitude 3 Hz activity which is well formed, but without definite spike or slow wave activity underlying it.
Photic stimulation elicits symmetric driving.
The patient had a single episode of right leg shaking.  This occurred after hyperventilation.  The EEG at this time identified a normal awake pattern.  The patient was able to answer questions throughout.  The activity lasted about 90 seconds and there was a bit of head bobbing associated with it.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This was a fasting record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with symmetric, reactive 10 Hz alpha rhythm reaching amplitudes up to 70  V with posterior slow waves of youth. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and elicits initially subtle, left temporal sharply contoured theta, which is somewhat irregular.  There appears to be a sharp wave varied in this frontotemporal theta.  The sharp wave can be identified on three different occasions.  Review of this activity with reformatting suggests a maximum at F7 but on other occasions in the left frontal region.  As hyperventilation continues, there are bursts of synchronous, high amplitude rhythmic frontally predominant delta.  Features of stage II sleep include high amplitude vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  Photic stimulation elicits symmetric driving.
HR:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Left anterior temporal focal slowing with a suspicious underlying sharp wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This second record again identifies left anterior temporal focal slowing.  The suspicious sharp wave merits additional evaluation to determine whether or not this patient is having behaviors which are seizures in addition to the behaviors which appear to have been confirmed not to be epileptiform.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 12 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with an increase in faster frequency activity and then attenuation of the alpha with background theta.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.  Photic stimulation is remarkable for LAMBDA activity, but also some driving at faster flash frequencies.  Hyperventilation produces a generous burst of high amplitude, frontally predominant 3 to 5 Hz activity.  The patient reports feeling tingling in the mouth and hands during HV.  The data is re-reviewed with appropriate sensitivities and even with fewer channels per page to make sure that there is no underlying spike and wave activity, and none can be determined

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG for an adult of this age in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The relatively fast alpha rhythm is not pathological.  There is a very vigorous, high amplitude response to hyperventilation, but there is no definite spike and wave activity.  In this individual with seizures a year ago, a repeat study with hyperventilation may be of value.  Alternatively, comparison with childhood EEGs may provide the same information.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz, 50 to 70 V posterior dominant rhythm, which is higher amplitude on the right compared to the left.  There is also a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.
The major abnormality is some subtle, isolated focal slowing from the left temporal region with a mixture of primarily theta but a smaller amount of delta activity.  Other features in stage I and into stage II sleep are prominent POSTS, which are higher amplitude on the left, and at times there is an appearance of almost a very subtle posterior temporal focus of isolated 3 Hz activity.  In addition, there is a discrete sharp wave identified again in the left mid to anterior region, which is identified in drowsiness and into stage II sleep.  This is also elicited in apparent wakefulness around the time of photic in relaxed wakefulness.  It occurs over a background of relatively sharply contoured activity with the potential for a normal variant such as wicket, but there seems to be only this discharge from the left temporal region.  There is no other phase reversal on the contralateral side and there is a bit of focal slowing underlying this rhythmic, sharply contoured activity.  All discharges are relatively small and discrete, but again identified on one occasion in relaxed wakefulness and on rare occasions into stage II sleep.
Hyperventilation produces vigorous background delta.  Photic stimulation elicits symmetric driving. 	HR:  60 BPM
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Subtle, left temporal focal slowing seen primarily in the anterior temporal region but on some occasions in the posterior temporal region with a small discrete sharp wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This activity is outside of the range of possibilities for a normal variant and consideration for a partial mechanism for epilepsy is recommended.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9.25 Hz, 70 to 80 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, which dramatically increases the amplitude of the background and produces a small amount of bitemporal slowing.  Occasionally the bitemporal slowing shows shifting asymmetries and may be irregular.  On one occasion, it is sharply contoured and irregular on the left following A.B.   Features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha, slow rolling eye movements, and somewhat irregular, sharply contoured theta identified from the temporal regions, left greater than right.  Vertex waves are seen in stage I sleep.  During photic stimulation, the patient is drowsy and during this portion of the record, there are left temporal sharp and slow wave complexes with bursts of sharply contoured activity during photic.  No driving response is elicited and after photic, the patient drifts off to stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There is a 7 Hz, 30 to 60 V dominant rhythm.  Intermittent bilateral as well as unilateral right focal slowing is characterized by frontal theta and delta.  There is a right frontal breech demonstrated by increased beta and increased amplitude of theta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there are more prominent bursts of frontal slowing and a breech on the right.  Although the EEG is abnormal, it is nearly symmetric and well organized at times. Hyperventilation produces right frontal delta.  Photic stimulation elicits symmetric driving.  There is no EEG change at the time of twitching.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The vast majority of the record is drowsy with a mixture of theta and beta frequency activity.  In this state, there is rare, subtle left frontotemporal slowing.  Sometimes this is picked up bilaterally in the frontal regions.  On occasion, this is associated with a discrete, left frontotemporal sharp wave maximum at F7 and T1, sometimes appearing as a couplet.  Features of deeper stages of sleep include vertex waves and spindles.  As the patient reaches stage II sleep, the EEG becomes more symmetric and more synchronous.  There are rare left anterior temporal sharp waves in stage II sleep.  These discrete discharges persist throughout the light sleep record.  In maximal wakefulness, the patient arouses and the EEG becomes well organized, symmetric with a low voltage, symmetric reactive 10.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of frontocentral beta activity.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial portions of the record, there is a marked intrahemispheric asymmetry.  From the left hemisphere, there is a 9.5 Hz, 35 V posterior dominant rhythm.  This is somewhat disrupted on the right, and the right hemisphere demonstrates disruption of faster frequency activity with arrhythmic delta activity particularly from the centrotemporal regions and T2 sharp and slow wave or spike and slow wave complexes. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and seems to accentuate this pattern. As the post-hyperventilation pattern resolves, the focal slowing becomes somewhat less prominent and the intrahemispheric asymmetry slightly less marked.  Later on, as the patient drifts into stage I and stage II sleep, there is again disruption of faster frequency activity particularly from the right frontal regions. Symmetric vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles are identified in stage II sleep.
Photic stimulation elicits brief driving bilaterally at faster flash frequencies.
HR:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing from the right hemisphere characterized by disruption of faster frequency activity as well as focal delta and theta activity maximum in the temporal regions.
T2 spike and slow wave complexes, which are overall high amplitude.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This record was compared to this patient’s five previous EEGs.  Some have demonstrated epileptiform activity on the right or left temporal regions, as well as others with bitemporal activity.  The activity in this record is much more marked on the right.  Correlation with imaging may be useful.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz, 60 V posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In this sharply contoured background, there are occasional left anterior temporal sharp and slow wave complexes with associated focal slowing.
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort producing occasional slowing from the temporal regions independently or bilaterally.  Following this, the patient becomes drowsy.  POSTS are seen in early stage I sleep.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.
Photic stimulation elicits symmetric driving.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
1.	Left temporal sharp waves with suspicious sharply contoured slowing from the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In the sharply contoured background, consideration for a study with more extensive sleep may be helpful to further delineate epileptiform activity from the background.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were attempted.  The patient spoke no English and had no caregiver to help translate. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial portions of the record are well-organized with a 9.25 Hz, 40 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In the initial portions of the record, the patient is a bit drowsy and hyperventilation is attempted.  There are bursts seen in this portion of the record in the temporal regions.  There are irregular bursts, which appear in the left or right temporal regions, sometimes a bit more on one side than the other or starting on the left and going to right or vice versa.  With the use of the T1-T2 electrodes, the activity appears to be maximum at T1 and there is an underlying sharp wave at T1-T3.  This becomes more prominent in the later HV recording. In these bursts, there are also T2 sharp waves and a sharply contoured background.  Following hyperventilation, as the patient becomes drowsy, there are additional sharp waves again seen at T1.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in the irregular temporal theta and the occasional sharp waves.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Irregular temporal slowing with an unusual field of spread often involving both temporal regions but asynchronous.
Left greater than right temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy.  If further characterization of this patient’s epilepsy is needed, an additional recording capturing sleep or one of her seizures would be helpful.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10.4 Hz, 50 to 60 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm followed by attenuation of the alpha with a handful of vertex waves.  In the transition to sleep, there are some bursts of mixed rhythmic theta and delta, which are somewhat irregular but not epileptiform in nature.  An identical 3-second burst is seen at the close of hyperventilation.
At the close of the record, wicket activity is identified in the transition to and from sleep, which is somewhat asymmetric, a little bit more prominent on the left than the right.
HR:  68 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The somewhat unusual response in hyperventilation and seen with a paroxysmal, somewhat irregular burst in HV and on one occasion in drowsiness, is not epileptogenic in nature and is of unclear clinical significance.  The asymmetric wicket described above is a normal finding.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is fairly organized with low voltage.  There is a 9 Hz, 15 V posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of frontocentral beta activity.  Frequent vertex waves, spindles, and K complexes were identified.  The patient was awakened by his snoring, but he rapidly went back to stage II sleep.  Moderate muscle activity is seen with snoring.  Photic stimulation elicited mild driving.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is lethargic, but answers questions.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This bedside portable EEG is relatively low voltage.  The patient is lethargic and there is a fair amount of muscle artifact.  There is a suggestion of a posterior dominant rhythm of 7.5 Hz, 15 V in a background that is low voltage with beta and small quantities of low voltage theta.  When the patient is awake and opening and closing his eyes, the alpha rhythm is a bit more prominent.  As the recording continues, the patient is increasingly alert.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The major abnormality in this record are bursts of frontally predominant, well formed, high amplitude 3.5 to 5 Hz spike and slow wave activity.  A typical burst duration is three seconds, but bursts can be seen that are longer, up to 5 seconds including some that have some theta.  In addition, there are rare, subtle frontal  spike and wave complexes, a handful of which are maximum in the right frontal region or the left and which appears as a couplet with first one in the left and the second in the right or vice versa.  The epileptiform activity is clearly accentuated in hyperventilation and in early drowsiness.  Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved.
Photic stimulation elicits a photoparoxysmal response with brief bursts of high amplitude frontally predominant 4 to 6 Hz spike and slow wave activity.  None of the bursts last the duration of the stimulus and in one occasion the burst is seen following HV.  There is a single burst of 5 Hz spike and slow wave activity immediately following hyperventilation.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Generalized, 3-6 Hz spike and slow wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a generalized mechanism for epilepsy.  These results are similar to previous records.  The presence of occasional frontal isolated spikes can be seen in an inherited generalized mechanism for epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake and drowsy record. No clinical seizures were recorded.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. The major abnormality in this record is a total of seven generalized spike and slow wave complexes, most of which are 5 Hz, but occasionally slightly slower or faster. Typical bursts are four seconds in duration, but there is a triplet of three bursts lasting a total of eight seconds. There is only a single, isolated frontal spike and slow wave complex, although there is a current burst. This generalized epileptiform activity occurs in wakefulness, seems to be elicited slightly in hyperventilation, perhaps elicited by photic stimulation, although it is clearly present in the background. Drowsiness may also be a precipitating factor. Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved.

INTRODUCTION: Digital EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz symmetric reactive posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity. Weakness observed. The patient is drowsy throughout most of the record with background theta. Epileptiform is elicited in hyperventilation, drowsiness, and photic stimulation. The vast majority of this activity is rhythmic, frontally predominant, symmetric, a 2-7 Hz spike and wave activity. It is clearly accentuated by photic stimulation. On rare occasions an occipitally predominant 7 Hz spike and wave complexes are also observed. Duration of the spike and wave bursts are typically 2 seconds, but some are as long as 4 seconds.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 30 to 50 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. In wakefulness, on rare occasions, there is a small amount of discrete beta activity from the right temporal region.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and again produces a small amount of discrete, rhythmic theta activity.  Some of this is identified in the posterior regions on the right and measures at 6 Hz.    As hyperventilation continues, there are one or two bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta activity from the temporal regions.  Following hyperventilation, there is some EKG artifact in the right temporal region.  Despite this, there is subtle, discrete right temporal slowing and a handful of tiny, discrete right temporal sharp waves, which can be differentiated from the patient’s EKG and are identified in quiet wakefulness.
Photic stimulation elicits brief driving.  At the close of the record, just following hyperventilation, intermittent bursts of background slowing with vertex waves and K complexes are identified followed by arousals, supportive of stage II sleep.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The awake background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  The most striking abnormality in this record is a high amplitude spike and slow wave, poly spike and slow wave complex identified from the right hemisphere with a generous field of spread including C4, P4, and T4.  The focal spiking may be intermittent, periodic, or occur in transient clusters.  When the spiking stops, the posterior dominant rhythm on the right is well defined and there are portions of the record where it is defined bilaterally.  As the patient becomes drowsy, the epileptiform activity becomes increasingly periodic and the EEG develops a small degree of discontinuity in sleep around the epileptiform activity.
Photic stimulation elicits primarily a photoelectric effect, but there is a suggestion of a driving response underneath that.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and asleep record with photic stimulation done.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Current EEG is abnormal. There is generalized background slowing with alpha rhythm of 7.8 Hertz bilaterally.  In addition, there is an interhemispheric asymmetry with higher amplitude on the left, a digital focal slowing on the left, with sharply contoured slowing on the left. Vertex waves are seen during sleep. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. The heart rate is 48 beats per minute and irregular.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild generalized frontal background slowing.
Superimposed focal slowing, most prominent in the temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. The focal slowing is congruent with the left temporal stroke history.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric and fairly well organized.  There is a 10 Hz, 30 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Wicket activity can be seen in the right temporal area.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in the background amplitude as well as a small amount of slowing.  In drowsiness discrete T4 sharp activity, occasionally with slow activity, was seen.  Sleep is characterized by slow rolling eye movements, followed by theta.  In stage II sleep: spindles, and K complexes.
Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving bilaterally, with an unusual  photoparoxysmal response which included  slowing  with frequency evolution but no spike and wave activity and no clinical symptoms.
HR:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Discrete right temporal sharp activity with associated underlying focal slowing.
Unusual photoparoxysmal response
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to this patient’s previous EEG done on December 18, 2002, this tracing yields a similar discrete right temporal sharp activity supporting a partial mechanism of epilepsy in this patient.  The photoparoxysmal response was reported in this patients’ childhood records.  Wicket activity is a normal variant.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine outpatient digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation was deferred due to the patient's pulmonary condition.  This is an awake and asleep record in a patient, who is very drowsy, dropping in and out of stage 2 sleep and falling forward to sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the EEG is well organized with a posterior dominant rhythm of 9.5 Hz.  As the patient becomes drowsy, the posterior dominant rhythm slows.  In the transition towards sleep, there are intermittent bursts of rhythmic slowing from the right hemisphere.  Features of stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  Multiple sleep arousals were noted.
The early section of the record demonstrates mu, but testing was not performed to confirm this.

Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in the background beta activity, as well as attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  As the tracing continues, the patient is increasingly restless and the EEG has increasing amounts of muscle.
Photic stimulation elicits brief, bilateral driving at intermediate flash frequencies.
HR:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness through stage I sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  There were no specific hallmarks of a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep may be helpful.

This is an awake and asleep record. Of note, the patient was experiencing a feeling as if he was about to have one of his attacks on the day of this study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm of 50 uV with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The overall waking background is well organized. On one occasion in drowsiness and during hyperventilation, there are occasional, brief bursts lasting one to five seconds, typically on the order of three seconds, of slightly irregular theta.  Particularly during hyperventilation, the theta seems to be a bit more prominent on the right with disruption of the posterior dominant rhythm on the right. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.
The patient experiences an ongoing feeling throughout the EEG as if he is about to have one of his spells and at 14:39 he reports pressure in his right leg. He reports to the tech at 14:47 that the right leg feels numb at that time.  No EEG changes are seen in association with these symptoms, and the brief bursts of slightly irregular slowing are not seen at the specific times that the patient reports his symptoms.

INTRODUCTION: Digital  video  EEG  is  performed  in  the  lab using  standard  10-20 system of electrode  placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF  THE  RECORD:  In  maximum  wakefulness, there  is  a  10  Hz posterior  dominant  rhythm  with  a generous  amount  of  low  voltage,  frontocentral beta activity.    Intermittently, in  wakefulness, there  is excess  background theta  and  in  the transition  to  drowsiness the  background  becomes  somewhat  disorganized  with  excess delta.    Hyperventilation is  performed with  good  effort  producing   bursts  of  rhythmic, frontally  predominant delta as well as the pattern of intermittent, slightly  irregular delta. Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.

HR:  102BPM.


IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:

INTRODUCTION: Portable  digital  video  EEG is performed  in  the lab  using standard  10-20 system  of electrode  placement  with one channel  of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE  RECORD: In wakefulness,  the background  EEG is symmetric  and well  organized  for  age. There  is  an  11 Hz,  50 uV posterior  dominant  alpha  rhythm,  which attenuates with eyes opened.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. As the EEG continues, wicket activity is seen. In drowsiness, bursts  of generalized 3 Hz, poly spike and wave activity lasting for about four seconds is seen.  On the video camera,  the patient was found to have fluttering eyes, which correlates with the burst of spike and wave activity.  No significant changes in the background were seen after the bursts of epileptiform  activity when the patient was awoken from the episode.

Photic stimulation  elicits driving.

HR.: 90BPM.

INTRODUCTION: Digital  video EEG is performed  in the lab using standard  10-20 system of electrode placement  with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This i s an one­ hour EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 9Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness  is characterized by slow rolling  eye movements.  Vertex waves,  K complexes,  and spindles  are  seen  in sleep.   In the transition to drowsiness,  there are  brief  bursts  of frontally predominant  very high amplitude spike and slow wave activity.  Tl1e sensitivity  of the EEG must be adjusted to 20 uV/mm.  There are discrete bursts that appear and can be differentiated from the patient's  other normal  morphologies of sleep.   As the patient more cl early transitions  to stage I sleep,  the  vertex waves  that  were  noted  are broader  in  morphology.    There  seems  to be  an asymmetry technically between the two regions.
In this one-hour recording, these brief bursts  of frontally predominant spike and wave activity are notable.
Photic stimulation  elicits a driving response.  No photoparoxysmal  response  was noted.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient has a prominent craniotomy in the right frontal region.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG is markedly abnormal and slow.  In fact, the right hemisphere is not as slow as the left.  There is a 7 Hz alpha rhythm on the right.  The left hemisphere demonstrates lower voltage and slower theta.  The right hemisphere demonstrates a prominent breach rhythm at C4 with prominent accentuation of beta frequency activity.  As the patient transitions to sleep, however, there are some sharp waves and spikes noted at C4-P4.  Photic stimulation elicits a driving response more prominently from the right than the left.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Markedly abnormal background with marked asymmetry.
A slow pattern on the left.
A pattern that is also abnormal on the right with C4 sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a process involving the left hemisphere more significantly than the right.  This may reflect the  bilateral nature of this patient's multiple CNS insults.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  No previous records were available for comparison.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In the transition to drowsiness, there is occasional temporal wicket, but there is a suspicious, underlying right temporal sharp wave identified in early drowsiness.
As the patient emerges to and from sleep, there is some rhythmic frontal mixed theta and delta, which is on the whole symmetric, although on one or two occasions there is a suggestion of maximum on the right.  Stage II sleep is characterized by vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  On two occasions, there are bursts of rhythmic frontally predominant, paroxysmal activity.  On one occasion, this occurs in the setting of hyperventilation and there seems to be some underlying eye blink, but there is suspicious, 3 to 5 Hz frontally predominant spike and slow wave and poly spike and slow wave activity followed by a more clearly defined eye blink.  The second burst occurs with the transition to sleep.  Again, the burst is less than two seconds long with approximately 5 Hz frontally predominant spike and wave/poly spike and wave activity.  No eye blink can be seen at this time, although the activity is picked up on the eye monitor at the midline.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the Neuro ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is continuous and symmetric with generalized slowing.  There is a 7 to 8 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm, which is well attenuated with eyes opened.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Soon after the EEG commences, the patient began to shake her left arm and then both arms and hands on her abdomen.  The shaking was in a different direction at different rhythms.  The patient could open and close her eyes and follow commands during this episode.  Alternatively, when her left-hand shaking stopped, she began to open and close her legs with shaking, left side worse then the right.  With the prolonged episode, muscle movement artifact can be seen, but no significant EEG changes or correlates were found.  On the video camera, several doctors were called to see the patient.  The patient can open and close her eyes, follow commands, and lift her arms and legs up.  Interestingly, the patientÕs episodes spontaneously subsided if no one paid attention to her and she responded to a placebo of saline injection.  Throughout the EEG, there were no epileptiform discharges, but occasionally sharply contoured delta activity in the left central area is seen.

HR:  116 BPM.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Diffusely slow background.
2. Occasional sharply contoured delta in the left central area.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The diffusely slow background, as well as occasional sharply contoured delta activity in the left central area may be suggestive of an underlying pathological process in this patient, which is commonly seen in patients with hypertension and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.  This finding can also be seen in patients with subdural hematoma.  During the tracing, the patient had prolonged episodes of arm or leg shaking without EEG change, as well as being responsive to commands.  This is suggestive of non-epileptic seizures.  These findings were communicated with the primary neurosurgery team.  If epilepsy is a clinical concern or clinically indicated, when the patient is more stable and cooperative, a repeat EEG in the lab with full activation including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, as well as capturing deeper stages of sleep may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the/at the lab/bedside? using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The vast majority of the waking record is poorly organized, although at the very end of the record, the background EEG is actually reasonably well organized with a low voltage pattern and a 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  In the early portions of the record, when the patient appears to be awake, the background EEG is moderately disorganized with some shifting slowing.  There is also some temporal wicket activity seen.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and elicits rhythmic bursts of frontally predominant, high amplitude delta, which are quite prominent.  In addition, underlying this, there are some right temporal sharp waves.  In the post-HV recording, there is an underlying right temporal sharp and slow wave activity.
Photic stimulation elicits a photoelectric artifact only.
HR:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Despite the technical limitations described above, this EEG is abnormal due to:
Right temporal sharp waves.
Shifting arrhythmic delta activity seen particularly in the initial portions of the record.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a partial mechanism for this patient’s epilepsy.  The dynamic changes with improvement in the organization towards the end of the record may be part of this patient’s recovery from some sort of acute disturbance, which may be postictal, metabolic, or post-syncope. With a prominent frontal delta in HV, this is a non-specific finding and comparison with previous studies may be valuable.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz, 30 to 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm. In wakefulness, there are occasional, high amplitude left anterior temporal spike and slow wave complexes.  These reach amplitudes well over 100 uV and are preceded and followed by focal slowing.  There is intermittent left mid-to-anterior temporal focal slowing seen in brief bursts lasting less than one second with a mixture of delta and theta frequency activity, as well as a disruption of alpha frequency activity.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is also some rhythmic left temporal theta identified. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background beta, as well as attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  The drowsy record is primarily recorded in referential montage, and the left anterior temporal spike and slow wave complexes can be identified in this montage.
Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.  The epileptiform discharges are also seen in photic stimulation, but are not clearly accentuated by this procedure.
HR:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal spike and slow wave activity identified in wakefulness.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm is 8.5-9 Hz in frequency, 30-35 microvolt in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is 7-7.5 Hz diffuse theta activity seen during wakefulness, which is distributed symmetrically.  There is presence of stage 1 sleep characterized by disappearance of alpha rhythm, slowing of the background activity and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves.  Brief stage II sleep was captured characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and did not result in a driving response.  Hyperventilation was also performed and results in diffuse slowing of the background activity.  Heart rate was 70-80 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to excess theta activity during wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings could be due to toxic, metabolic, hypoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of sedating medication or bilateral cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures are identified in this record.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is abnormal. The right hemisphere is relatively well organized with a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz, 30 uV.  The left hemisphere demonstrates intermittent arrhythmic delta activity seen occasionally in wakefulness, accentuated by hyperventilation, maximum in the temporal region.  There are a handful of left anterior temporal sharp waves identified in hyperventilation in the bursts of rhythmic slowing.  Following hyperventilation, as the patient becomes drowsy, the focal slowing from the left is accentuated.  On one occasion there is a train of sharp waves identified from the left temporal region, as well as a single right temporal sharp wave.  These can be differentiated from the patient’s EKG artifact.   On some occasions, there is a somewhat periodic left temporal sharp wave picked up, but mixed in this discharge there will be a subtle right anterior temporal sharp wave.  Vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles are seen in stage II sleep.  The epileptiform activity appears to decrease in stage II sleep.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz, 80 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a modest amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing a small amount of slowing as well as increasing the amplitude of the background.  At the end of hyperventilation, there is a single burst of arrhythmic delta seen first on the left and then on the right.  Following this, the patient becomes drowsy with an increase in background beta as well as occasional vertex waves.  Stage II sleep is characterized by vertex waves, K complexes, and POSTS with intermittent arousals from sleep.  As she awakens from sleep for photic stimulation, a hypersynchronous pattern is identified.
Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving response seen with a spiky driving at 5 Hz, but no definite spike and slow wave complex.
HR:  56 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This EEG must be considered normal in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The single asynchronous burst seen in hyperventilation is of unclear clinical significance.  Given the pattern identified with a 5 Hz driving response, comparison with childhood EEGs may be helpful in characterizing this patient’s epilepsy.  Alternatively, additional recording with repeat photic stimulation at various frequencies and/or accentuated by hyperventilation could be helpful.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a symmetric, reactive 10 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The major abnormality in this record is occipitally predominant rhythmic approximately 5 Hz activity.  This can be seen in wakefulness and is clearly accentuated in hyperventilation.  On some occasions it is seen into stage II sleep.  This activity can be reviewed in both circle montage and a referential montage.  In hyperventilation, this activity appears to be sometimes maximum on the right spreading to the left, but in other settings, the activity appears to be symmetric, nearly identical or clearly identical at O1 and O2.  During hyperventilation, the occipitally predominant theta frequency activity has some paroxysmal build up, but does not evolve.  Other features of hyperventilation include both eye blink and hypersynchronous rhythmic high amplitude delta.
Features of stage II sleep include vertex waves and spindles.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  Some of the occipitally predominant bursts can be seen even in photic.
HR:  82 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Occipitally predominant, 5 to 6 Hz theta activity, increasing in hyperventilation and persisting into stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: To further localize this activity, a follow-up study with special electrodes may be valuable.  Correlation with neuroimaging may be helpful.  These findings were not seen on this patient’s previous EEG.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a somewhat slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm of 7.5 Hz, 40 microvolts. There is excess background theta. There are occasional bursts of delta  typically in the right or left temporal region, more commonly in the right than the left. Some of these are associated with a sharp wave with field of spread  including frontotemporal and frontocentral. Those from the left are more typically temporal. In addition there is a small amount of temporal rhythmic theta from the
left. Features of drowsiness include accentuation of the temporal lobe features described above.
Other features include slowing and attenuation of the alpha. Photic stimulation elicits a modest driving response.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Sharp waves seen most commonly from the right hemisphere with an anterior temporal or frontal maximum.
2. 	Occasional sharp waves from the left with associated slowing.
3. 	Excess background theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a localization related mechanism for epilepsy. Given the patient's age, correlation with imaging as well as with previous EEGs is important to make sure that the focal features are not more prominent than previously observed. The
background slowing may be due to this patient's medications.

MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 to 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  It is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing with occasional vertex waves in stage I sleep. Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta.  In photic stimulation, there is a discrete driving response.  In addition, the left posterior temporal discrete sharp and slow wave complexes are identified, maximum at T5, but at times involving O1 and P3.  It may occur during photic stimulation or just after.  The discharges are all single, isolated discharges never appearing in trains or pairs.
HR:  90 BPM.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In wakefulness, there is frequent eye blink, but in the transition from wakefulness to drowsiness, there is also notched, sharply contoured, frontally predominant 5 to 7 Hz activity in the frontal regions, as well as a signal left mid-to-anterior temporal sharp wave.  There were a total of four left anterior temporal sharp waves.  Features of sleep include an increase in beta activity as well as occasional vertex waves and spindles.  There are multiple brief arousals from sleep.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and appears to accentuate some of the rhythmic frontal 5 to 7 Hz activity.  In sleep, there is a second, left temporal sharp wave.
Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Some sharply contoured, notched 5 to 7 Hz activity seen in the frontal regions, sometimes with isolated discharges and sometimes seen with brief bursts seen in wakefulness and in sleep.
Rare left anterior temporal sharp waves.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is in stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles. The patient is alerted for hyperventilation.  As she does so, there is some wicket activity identified in the left anterior temporal region.  The awake record demonstrates a 9 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  Hyperventilation produces an increase of the amplitude of the background.  Following HV, the patient drifts back to stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles.  Photic stimulation elicits an alerting response with scant driving.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage I sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 8.5 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In the transition to drowsiness, there is some slightly irregular temporal bursts seen with some shifting asymmetries left and right.  On one or two occasions, there is a T1 phase reversal.  Other features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing.  Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved. Of note, there is some electrode artifact picked up in the T2 electrode in drowsiness.
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces some background slowing as well as a single burst of sharply contoured left temporal delta activity. Photic stimulation elicits symmetric driving.

IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Irregular, shifting temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is a clear burst of sharply contoured delta activity from the left temporal region and some suspicious sharp activity in drowsiness.  Some of this resembles wicket and with a combination of the electrode artifact and the wicket, no definitive conclusions regarding clearly epileptiform activity can be made.  In comparison to a previous EEG in April 2004, the previous EEG was normal.  A repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep would be helpful to more clearly evaluate this individual for seizures.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric.  There is an 11 Hz, 15 uV posterior dominant rhythm and diffuse excessive beta activity.  Hyperventilation increases the slow activity in the background.  Sleep is evidenced by vertex waves, spindles, and K complexes. Single sharp wave was identified at T3, unfortunately this channel also has some artifact.  Photic stimulation elicits driving.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: A single sharp wave in a single channel after arousal appears may have been an artifact.  To further characterize this patients’ epilepsy a follow-up study with more prolonged sleep may be helpful.  The excessive beta activity may be due to medications such as Phenobarbital.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded in stage I and stage II sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen frequently at F7/T1.
Focal slow waves seen almost continuously at F7/T1 throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal sharp waves.
Continuous slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy, with seizures likely arising from the left anterior temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which has a high correlation with a structural lesion in that region.  No seizures were seen.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  A subtle asymmetry is noted between the 2 hemispheres with a bit of 7 Hz theta noted in the right hemisphere relative to the left and very subtle disruption of the alpha rhythm on the right.  As the patient becomes drowsy, the record becomes increasingly synchronous and symmetric.  Other features of drowsiness include rhythmic background theta and attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  Brief spindles were noted with POSTS in stage 2 sleep.  Photic stimulation was performed as the patient is drifting in to stage 2 sleep, and did not significantly activate the record.  Hyperventilation produced a vigorous hyperventilation response with an increase in rhythmic theta as well as an increase in beta.  There is some subtle, asymmetric bursts noted in hyperventilation with higher amplitude rhythmic theta noted on the left.  There is one, suspicious underlying sharp waves noted at the close of hyperventilation in the right centrotemporal region.
Heart rate 56 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a subtly abnormal EEG due to:

DESCRIPTION OF THE  RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9 Hz, 40 to 60 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  In wakefulness, early drowsiness, and hyperventilation,  there is intermittent  rhythmic left mid-temporal theta activity of 3 to 5 Hz, somewhat sharply contoured. In addition, there is occasional, somewhat more arrhythmic delta activity seen with rare left anterior temporal sharp waves. Hyperventilation and drowsiness both augment the focal slowing seen from the left temporal region. Stage I sleep is characterized by vertex waves followed by arousals.

Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving. The rhythmic left temporal theta was seen during hyperventilation, but was not clearly augmented by it.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and doesn’t seem to activate the record.  The patient seems to be a bit drowsy.  Following hyperventilation, however, there is some rhythmic theta picked up in the temporal regions, particularly in the T1-T2 electrodes more so on the left than the right.  In addition, despite some EKG artifact, there are some underlying sharp waves seen primarily at T1, but occasionally at T2 as well.   As the patient drops into stage I sleep, again the sharp waves and rhythmic temporal delta are seen in bursts.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9 Hz, 30 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Photic stimulation is performed early on in the record.  A brief driving response is seen, but as the patient relaxes a little bit further, subtle left temporal slowing is seen.  Hyperventilation is performed subsequently and the subtle focal features can be identified.  A seizure occurred following hyperventilation and post-hyperventilation.  Post-hyperventilation, the focal slowing gradually increases 20 seconds after the onset of hyperventilation.  The seizure onset is at 14:08:37 with no clinical signs, but high amplitude spike and slow wave activity with rhythmic delta and then high amplitude delta and sharply contoured delta with a clear phase reversal at T1.  The patient starts to arouse at 14:08:57, opening his eyes and then stiffening.  He is slightly tremulous and demonstrates chewing movements.  The activity makes the transition to repetitive alpha frequency activity and then 5 Hz frequency activity by 14:09:17.  The activity begins to slow and ends at 14:09:38 for an approximate one-minute seizure duration.  The background EEG demonstrates postictal slowing in the minutes that follow, which gradually resolves.  The patient is unable to speak during the seizure and in the postictal period he nods his head from side to side.  He has a relatively lengthy postictal period including almost all the way to the end of the record.  Over time, he becomes increasingly able to speak, although initially he answers all questions with “uhm-uhm” noise.  Over time, he can answer questions, but has difficulty performing simple tasks.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9.5 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and produces an increase in the amplitude of the background, as well as accentuating some wicket, but no definite epileptiform features were seen in hyperventilation.  Following hyperventilation, as the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in background rhythmic theta.  Features of sleep include vertex waves and occasional spindles.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.  Photic stimulation elicits a bilateral driving response with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.
HR:  59 BPM.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a high amplitude 50 to 75 uV posterior dominant rhythm of 10.5 Hz. Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  Other features of drowsiness include a handful of POSTS and an increase in background theta.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
A single burst of frontally predominant spike and slow wave activity of 6 Hz in duration.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: A single burst of epileptiform activity does not make this record abnormal, however, the activity described above is compatible with a primary generalized epilepsy.  It may be more cost effective to compare this EEG with previous, childhood studies rather than repeating a study.  Alternatively, if additional mechanisms are needed to characterize epileptiform activity, a fasting, sleep deprived study with generous hyperventilation could be effective.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized for a child of this age.  There is a 9.5 Hz, 70 to 80 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a fair amount of theta.   There is intermittent rhythmic left posterior temporal spike and sharp waves with occasional generalized bursts of spike wave activity lasting two to three seconds.  Hyperventilation and post-hyperventilation seems to accentuate the discharges, which are followed by brief slowing for several seconds thereafter.  The left posterior temporal discharges are localized at T5, and occasional sharp waves are also noted on the right parietal area at P4 without causing generalized spread. The generalized discharges are frontally predominant and seem to arise out of a left temporal focus maximum at T5.  Photic stimulation elicits discrete driving.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Bursts of generalized spike wave discharges, which are preceded by a left posterior temporal discharge focus.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record. This is the third EEG for this individual.  The two previous EEGs indicated that he had febrile convulsions.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for a child of this age with an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  In sleep, vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles are identified.
The major abnormality in this record, is discrete bursts of frontally predominant 3 Hz spike and wave activity seen in the transition to and from stage II sleep.  These are high amplitude discharges, typically occurring in discrete pairs, frontally predominant, symmetric, ranging from 3 to 3.5 Hz.  They can overlap with a spindle, which is a normal morphology of stage II sleep.  On one occasion, a pair of spike and wave complexes may be associated with an arousal.  At the close of the record, the child is stimulated from sleep, and occipitally predominant rhythmic slowing is followed by an awake pattern with LAMBDA when the child is more fully awake.
HR:  120 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	The appearance of frontally predominant, high amplitude spike and wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This activity was not seen in the two previous EEGs.  Correlation with this patient’s history may be helpful in that there were two previous EEGs demonstrating febrile convulsions with a child who may have developed afebrile convulsions and an EEG pattern that is most consistent with an inherited epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient seems to be very
sleep. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage. The left
hemisphere demonstrates more of a lower voltage beta pattern with a difficult to discern
alpha rhythm. The right hemisphere is more low voltage beta and some subtle rhythmic
theta delta activity including 4 Hertz theta and 1-2 Hertz delta. Features of drowsiness
included increase in beta and on rare occasions a few broadly contoured right anterior
temporal sharp waves. This is really primarily sharply contoured delta. Hyperventilation
does not activate the record. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intra hemispheric asymmetry with slowing of the right hemisphere which includes
increased delta and theta and decreased alpha and beta.
2. Sharply contoured delta from the right.
3. Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to his most recent study in
2005. Correlation with imaging is advised.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.   There are no previous records available for comparison. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is high amplitude with an 8.5  to 9 Hz, 75 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.   Drowsiness is characterized by increasing rhythmicity of the background.  Photic stimulation produces vigorous bilateral driving.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz, symmetric, reactive posterior dominant rhythm of 30 to 50 uV. There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. There is some eye movement artifact picked up in the temporal regions as well as some EKG artifact. Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, producing an increase in theta in the background. Following HV, as the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in background beta and some rhythmic central theta. In drowsiness, there is also some rare, rhythmic 4 to 5 Hz activity from the left temporal region. This is seen on a single location with brief bursts lasting less than a second. Photic stimulation elicits both vigorous driving and some photoelectric artifact. On two occasions, in photic stimulation with a 17 Hz stimulation and following the 15 Hz stimulation, there seems to be some rhythmic focal slowing with a mixture of theta and delta identified from the left hemisphere.
HR: 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Bursts of somewhat irregular slowing identified following photic stimulation from the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Although there are a handful of other features including a brief burst of theta from the left, which may be a normal variant, the more remarkable slowing seen in photic stimulation raises the possibility of either a structural or functional abnormality on the left. In this individual with a childhood history of generalized spike and slow wave activity, this finding has not been seen in either of her two adult EEGs. Individuals with childhood epilepsy may haw focal features in adulthood, but those described here are unusual for that.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm of 50 uV with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and an increase in background beta.  Vertex waves are identified in stage I sleep.  POSTS are identified in stage I sleep.  Photic stimulation elicits a driving response at 1 Hz and faster flash frequencies with a markedly vigorous driving response but without a photoparoxysmal response.  In hyperventilation, there is a single left mid-temporal sharp and slow wave complex.
HR:  __ BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There was only a single left temporal sharp wave identified in this record, therefore, it must be considered a normal EEG.  Of note, in comparison to previous records, there is no generalized spike and slow wave activity and with only one sharp wave, this must be considered potentially an artifact.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, background EEG included the 9.5 posterior dominant rhythm a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. There is a small amount of background theta. In relaxed wakefulness, there are a handful of subtle sharp waves from the left or right temporal region. Most of them are small and discreet, but some have a more of a broader morphology, although they are never high in amplitude. They lack the simplicity of benign epileptiform transience of sleep. The patient has stimulated for hyperventilation and these morphologies disappear. Hyperventilation is performed with good effort producing an increase in background theta. There is a suggestion that it may also accentuate an arrhythmic delta from the left with independent right and left temporal sharp and slow wave, or spike and slow wave complexes. The epileptiform activity identified in hyperventilation was denoted on the record. Towards the close of the record, high amplitude right inter temple spike and slow wave complexes with generous field of spread were observed. As the patient becomes drowsy, the right temporal sharp waves are again well defined and the left temporal features are not as commonly identified. Other features of sleep include vertex waves and posts. Photic stimulation elicits harmonic with supra harmonic striving.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right anterior temple spike and slow wave complexes accentuated by hyperventilation and seen in the transition from wakefulness into drowsiness.
2. Occasional more poorly defined left temporal sharp waves.
Clinical correlation: For this young adult with a strong family history of epilepsy, this study today is most supportive of a localization related mechanism with a right inter temple sharp wave with a generous field of spread. There is a remarkably bigger striving response, but not a clearly pathological one.
Additional review of the epilepsy in the family would be important to know if this individual's epilepsy is similar or just similar to other members in the kindred. In contrast to previous studies, the vast majority of epileptiform features today were on the right rather than the left.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a symmetric, reactive, 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Wicket activity is identified from the temporal regions bilaterally. Discrete right temporal sharp waves are noted at T2. They are so discrete in nature and occur out of the wicket that they almost look like an artifact; however, there is clearly an after-going slow wave and there is disruption of the background. They are also nearly the amplitude of the EKG artifact but clearly can be differentiated from the EKG as fortunately they do not occur in conjunction with the EKG. These appear in relaxed wakefulness as the patient start to drift off toward sleep. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous bilateral driving response.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric, continuous, and well organized for age. There is a 10 Hz, 40 (phi)V posterior dominant alpha rhythm, which is waxing and waning in appearance. It is well attenuated with eyes opened, and there is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and does not provoke an abnormal response. Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved in this tracing. Photic stimulation elicits driving.
HR: 78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record. Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy. If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or sleep deprivation prior to the EEG may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing an increase in the amplitude of the background, as well as some rhythmic slowing.  Following hyperventilation, there are rare occasions where there is subtle, asymmetric 3 to 4 Hz activity identified from the right hemisphere, particularly in the centroparietal and temporal regions.  Features of stage II sleep include vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.
LAMBDA waves are identified in wakefulness.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is in the OR.  He may have been sedated, but induction has not occurred.  There is a 7 to 8 Hz background at 8:24:39 and an anesthetic pattern with the appearance of rhythmic frontal delta and some triangular-shaped waves in the posterior region.  Following the induction of anesthesia, the EEG is slightly discontinuous, but there is no significant focality.  The discontinuity waxes and wanes and is at times subtle.  Heparin is given at 10:15, and the initial clamp is placed at 11:01.  The EEG becomes somewhat discontinuous at 11:02.  These findings are communicated to the surgeon who requests a shunt.  In the discontinuous pattern, there is also a bit of shifting asymmetry.  In addition, there is some slowing identified out of the left prior to placement of the shunt.  The shunt is opened at 11:05.  In addition, as the shunt is placed, there seems to have been a change in the level of anesthesia and in this low voltage pattern, there is more faster frequency activity.

MEDICATIONS: Desflurane, Propofol, Etomidate, Lidocaine, Synephrine, Fentanyl, Versed, and Heparin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the OR using standard CEA montage with one channel of EKG. The recording begins at 8:20 AM and concludes at 12:17 PM.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is in the OR.  He may have been sedated, but induction has not occurred.  There is a 7 to 8 Hz background at 8:24:39 and an anesthetic pattern with the appearance of rhythmic frontal delta and some triangular-shaped waves in the posterior region.  Following the induction of anesthesia, the EEG is slightly discontinuous, but there is no significant focality.  The discontinuity waxes and wanes and is at times subtle.  Heparin is given at 10:15, and the initial clamp is placed at 11:01.  The EEG becomes somewhat discontinuous at 11:02.  These findings are communicated to the surgeon who requests a shunt.  In the discontinuous pattern, there is also a bit of shifting asymmetry.  In addition, there is some slowing identified out of the left prior to placement of the shunt.  The shunt is opened at 11:05.  In addition, as the shunt is placed, there seems to have been a change in the level of anesthesia and in this low voltage pattern, there is more faster frequency activity.  The EEG returns to baseline by 11:06.  The clamp is removed and reclamped at 11:55, 12:01.  Patency is confirmed by doppler at 12:02.  Throughout the procedure, with the clamping  and unclamping, there is some waxing and waning with at times a bit more slowing on the left or the right and also some subtle discontinuity.
By the close of the recording at 12:17, there is some shifting asymmetries, with some head-rocking movements but a question of a bit more slowing in the left posterior quadrant.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. The patient’s previous EEGs were not available at this time.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is intermittent rhythmic theta from the left hemisphere.  Although there is a breach rhythm, and there is some muscle artifact, there appears to be an underlying spike and slow wave complex identified from the left mid-temporal region, accentuated by hyperventilation.  Following hyperventilation, the patient becomes drowsy and in drowsiness there are vertex waves and POSTS.  The amplitude is somewhat higher from the left than the right, accentuating the POSTS on the left.  As the patient reaches sleep, in this sharply contoured background, there is both accentuation of beta on the left but there are a handful of sharp waves that also come out of this background.  Snore artifact is also identified in stage II sleep.
Photic stimulation elicits a driving response, which is markedly accentuated on the left.
HR:  54 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Left temporal theta accentuated by drowsiness and hyperventilation.
Left temporal sharp waves in hyperventilation and in stage II sleep.  The morphology is compatible with a breach rhythm.

The focal slowing and sharp waves supports a temporal lobe disturbance and a localization-related mechanism for seizures.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The video has been deleted from the data provided.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing an increase in rhythmic slowing.  Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is becoming drowsy.  There is no clear photic driving response.  Following photic stimulation, stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles is noted.  Multiple spontaneous arousals from sleep are observed.
HR:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The pattern of spontaneous arousals from sleep can be seen in the context of a noisy environment, sleep deprivation, or obstructive sleep apnea.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient is poorly responsive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow, a theta pattern. With stimulation, there is an increase in faster frequency activity. There is an area of sharply contoured slowing in the right posterior temporal region. Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting response, but when stimulation ends, the patient drifts off to sleep with vertex waves and spindles. These focal features in the right posterior quadrant are not as remarkable in sleep.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long term monitoring, 6 hours EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  Wakefulness and sleep were recorded.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  After 10:00 at night until 6:00 in the morning from November 6 to November 7, 2011 there was marked muscle and multielectrode artifact to almost impossible reading the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record at the beginning opens to a diffusely slow low amplitude recording with no clear posterior dominant rhythm.  By 2 hours into the recording faster frequencies can be seen and improvement of the EEG to baseline was seen.  At best the posterior dominant rhythm reaches 8 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of frontal central beta seen.  Some sleep architecture is seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Occasional bursts of polyspike and generalized spike and waves seen at 4.5 to 5 Hz with anterior predominance  symmetrically over both hemispheres.  None of the bursts last more than 1 second.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz and 20-60 mV amplitude.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The EEG findings are consistent with those of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.  In addition, there is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  In this patient it is likely due, at least in part, to medication effect.  No seizures were seen.

Head-rocking artifact is picked up in the posterior scalp electrodes.  Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting response with an increase in beta and theta.  There are rare asymmetries with a bit higher amplitude rhythmic theta in the right or frontal regions.
HR:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background primarily with a pattern rich in beta frequency activity, but with smaller amounts of theta and alpha frequency activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The reactivity and variability are positive prognostic features.  Medications that produce beta may account for the pattern described above in this individual who is responsive to external stimuli.  There are no epileptiform features identified in this record, and the focal frontal features are subtle.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized for an adult of this age with a symmetric, reactive 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Features of drowsiness include vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, producing an increase in the amplitude of the background.
Towards the close of the record, as the patient is in stage II sleep and photic stimulation begins, there is some artifact but there are also some pairs of suspicious underlying left centrotemporal sharp waves of low amplitude and discrete, but appear to be interrupting the background.  The patient otherwise remains in stage II sleep during photic. Low voltage left temporal sharp waves are seen only in this section of the record, and almost seem to have an electropositivity between T3 and F7, but do appear to have otherwise a clear field in the left centrotemporal and posteriotemporal regions.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively low voltage.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, producing an increase in the amplitude of the background.  At that time, a low voltage 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm is identified bilaterally.  Despite movement artifact, there is a glimpse of a left mid-to-anterior temporal region in HV.  This is followed by a drowsy pattern at which point there is some subtle focal slowing discernable in the left anteriotemporal region.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, he begins to snore, again producing a fair amount of artifact.  Other features of sleep include some vertex activity.   In sleep, well-defined left anteriotemporal spike and slow wave complexes are identified.  The patient remains asleep during photic stimulation, with features of stage II sleep and spindles, but no clear driving.  In this sleep state, during HV, the left anteriotemporal spike and slow wave complexes are better defined and then the patient briefly awakens towards the end of HV.

Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well formed and modulated 9 Hz alpha activity that
attenuates with eye opening.  PDR is better formed and modulated over the left.  There is an
anterior-to-posterior frequency-amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes
anteriorly.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely,
followed by symmetric vertex waves.
There is continuous interhemispheric voltage asymmetry with lower voltages over the right.
Additionally, there is paucity of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere, especially over the
anterior and median quadrants.  Semi-rhythmic sharply contoured delta activity at 1-1.25 Hz is
observed over the right frontotemporal region during and following hyperventilation.  Occasional
right frontotemporal sharp waves are noted.  Maximal scalp negativity occurs over F8, T2, Fp2 and
F4 electrodes.  These discharges become more apparent during photic stimulation.  No clear
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) produces semi-rhythmic sharply
contoured right frontotemporal delta activity and accentuates right frontotemporal sharp waves.

hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the anterior and middle quadrants and occasional
right frontotemporal epileptiform discharges. Focal slowing and voltage attenuation over the right
is suggestive of focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology.  A potential epileptogenic

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is starting to emerge from paralysis and demonstrates stiffening and movements.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is a bit quieter. Activity demonstrates a slow pattern with some rhythmic mixed theta and delta on the left with a lower voltage, slower, a bit more suppressed pattern on the right, particularly in the temporal regions.
Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting with an increase in muscle as well as alpha and theta frequency activity. During the EEG, the patient starts to wake up, move around, and cough. After this, there is a more alert pattern with more theta frequency and alpha frequency activity from the left, but the right remains quite slow. By the end of the record in this very sharply contoured record, there was a suggestion of underlying sharp activity versus part of the fast activity at F3. In addition, more sharply contoured slowing is seen at T4-T6.

2. Occasional T4-T6 sharps and question F3 sharps as well.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe, bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function as would be expected following the use of sedative, hypnotic medications. The focal slowing and rare sharp waves on the right are compatible with past right temporal hemorrhage. Additional evaluation of this patient's cerebral function may be needed. Ongoing EEG monitoring was undertaken to make sure no additional seizures occurred.

This patient has an event during the EEG. The event occurs at 10:08 a.m. It is characterized by staring, jerking of the head from side to side. The EEG is remarkable for some sharp waves and some motion artifacts. The sharp waves are seen in the right frontocentral region. There is significant muscle activity. The patient is conversant during the spell. No postictal slowing is noted. Photic stimulation elicits a brief driving response on the left.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the right.
2. An event during the EEG without impairment of awareness. Although there is some artifact, there are some discharges in the same region as the patient's sharp waves. While the event might not be considered a simple partial or a complex partial seizure, the motor activity observed may be linked to the epileptiform activity elicited from the right frontocentral region which could have produced the features described above.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake through stage II sleep record with photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is markedly sharply contoured with a 9 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm with prominent temporal wicket seen from either region.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is a prominent increase in theta frequency activity.  Vertex waves and spindles are seen in stage II sleep.  Photic stimulation is attempted, but the patient has drifted back into stage II sleep.   Occasional snore arousals are noted in the background.
HR:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is a very sharply contoured background and a great deal of temporal wicket, but no definite epileptiform activity.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study may be of value.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient has an event during the EEG. Hyperventilation is performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Although the patient is markedly drowsy throughout much of the record, there is a 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta and theta.  Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort, producing an increase in the amplitude of the background.  At the end of hyperventilation, the patient has a single episode of both shoulders jerking at 11:37:07.  Slowly, at 11:53, she starts to have rocking of the head from side to side and then has rocking from side to side with alternating movements of the hands, with hands coming up and going down and then head rocking from side to side.  During this event, although there is some movement artifact, the EEG otherwise demonstrates an awake pattern.  The technologist interacts with the patient during the event giving her a code word.  The patient has multiple different behaviors during this episode including brief hyperextension of the back and then slow rocking from side to side.
Towards the end of the behavior, the tech uses a nasal tickle.  The patient looks apprehensive and at one point turns away just briefly, but doesn’t move substantially.  She does blink to threat during the event, and towards the end of the event, seems upset or angry and is staring away from the direction of the technologist.  As the technologist moves around the room, however, the patient can be seen to track the tech with her eyes.  After the event is over, the patient tells the tech that the only thing she can remember is that her name is [patient’s name].
HR:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Although the patient was initially quite drowsy, there is no epileptiform activity.  This patient had a complex and prolonged behavioral event without EEG change.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  This is this child’s third EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 6.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive.  There are portions of the record when the child is awake when the background is appropriately organized for age.
The major abnormalities in this record include complex epileptiform activity, which can be best viewed at fast paper speed of six seconds per page and/or average reference.  These include spike and slow wave complexes, which are high in amplitude and sometimes seem almost electropositive in the mid-temporal region, but in most of the montages are maximum at C3.  They are variable with some having a much more generous field of spread to the frontocentral region or left hemisphere and others more restricted.  They are picked up by volume conduction in the contralateral hemisphere.  In addition, there are some generalized frontally predominant spike and slow wave discharges, some of which are 3.5 to 4 Hz, but which are slightly irregular.  As the child drifts off to sleep, marked background slowing is observed and prominent, high amplitude slow spike and wave complexes are identified.  These are picked up in the frontocentral region, but more so on the left.
As the child drifts off to sleep, he is lying on his side, away from the camera and towards his mother.  Initially, he seems to have jerking forward of the head.  Subsequently, he seems almost to be having a salaam-like seizure as he drifts off to sleep, jerking towards his mother with his arms coming up a little bit.  This seems to elicit an arousal from sleep.  The epileptiform activity is high in amplitude, but some sections of the sleep record seem to demonstrate a sleep pattern that is remarkable for prominent attenuation of the typical morphologies in sleep with this high amplitude spike and slow wave pathology, most prominent in the frontal regions and again with an unusual field but with more of a predominance to the left hemisphere.  The child does fall off to sleep at 12:51.
HR:  114 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Prominent epileptiform activity with complex epileptiform activity, slow spike and wave activity, and focal spike and slow wave activity, but activity that on the whole raises concerns about a process involving the left hemisphere.
Concerns that the background activity in sleep is slower than expected particularly in the frontocentral regions, left greater than right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings must be correlated with imaging and clinical exam at this juncture.  They differ from the two previous EEGs, which were not successful in identifying epileptiform activity.

MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Dilantin, and Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a mainly asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Much of the record includes sleep.  Stage II sleep is well organized with vertex waves and spindles.  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, but there is occasionally some posterior delta seen bilaterally in wakefulness.  Hyperventilation elicits generalized background slowing, but again also some posterior rhythmic theta and delta.  Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is relatively asleep and does not activate the record.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is awake.  There is a 9 to 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a fair amount of eye artifact.   Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and does elicit some left anteriotemporal sharp and slow wave complexes in association with hyperventilation. Following hyperventilation, the patient becomes somewhat drowsy and there is a small amount of slowing in the left mid-temporal region in this somewhat drowsy pattern.  There is also a high amplitude left anteriotemporal spike and slow wave complex.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is a left anteriotemporal spike component, but this has a bifrontal field.  This activity can be reviewed with other montages where again it seems to be primarily left temporal with some spread into the eye movement channel.  It is prominent with almost a focal spike and wave component as the patient becomes drowsy and reaches stage II sleep.  Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is in stage II sleep and does not significantly activate the record.

They are not associated with loss of consciousness.

MEDICATIONS:

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There is limited maximal wakefulness with a well-defined alpha rhythm.  The alpha frequency is 12 Hz, 30 to 50 uV and is slightly higher amplitude on the left compared to the right.  Much of the record includes drowsiness or sleep with slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  In the transition to sleep, there is a drowsy pattern with rhythmic theta, which is identified bilaterally and is symmetric.  There is a slight amplitude asymmetry on some occasions as slowing develops in the record, with again slightly higher amplitude slowing from the left compared to the right.  Vertex waves in stage I sleep are symmetric.  POSTS are identified bilaterally.

Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, producing an increase in background beta.  Notably, at baseline, the patient’s heart rate is 72 BPM and irregular.  In hyperventilation, the heart rate becomes more irregular, increasing to 96 BPM and is associated with the feeling of light-headedness and a twitchy feeling.  The twitchy feeling is identified at 13:51.  No epileptiform features are identified at that time, although there is an increase in background beta.

Photic stimulation elicits a driving response bilaterally.  The driving response is quite vigorous, but in the slower frequency flash stimuli, it is higher amplitude and more prominent from the left compared to the right.

HR:  72 BPM, irregular.

IMPRESSION: Given the presence of an alpha asymmetry and the amplitude asymmetry, as well as the photic asymmetry, this is a mildly abnormal EEG due to:

Patient states that he if catches it, he can stop it.  History of head trauma at age 6 with seizures, with last seizure at age 13.  This patient did experience another episode, as was seen in a previous EEG, with the feeling of tachycardia.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. No clinical symptoms were reported during this EEG. The patient is known to have a right skull defect.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz, 30 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. In wakefulness, there is a small intrahemispheric asymmetry with accentuation of fast activity in the right frontocentral region compared to the left.  This is compatible with a breach rhythm.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.  During hyperventilation, the background EEG demonstrates an awake pattern with an increase in the amplitude and a small increase in theta.  Notably, in hyperventilation, the heart rate increases from 70 to 90 BPM.  The patient reports experiencing the typical symptoms of one of his events.
Photic stimulation is remarkable for a driving response.  The patient’s breach rhythm is somewhat more prominent during photic.
HR:  70 to 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In view of the breach rhythm, which is a manifestation of a previous skull defect, the amplitude asymmetries and the beta asymmetries are anticipated findings.  As was seen in a previous EEG, the patient again felt tachycardic during hyperventilation and again demonstrated an increase in heart rate.
Additional, neurocardiac monitoring may be helpful to further characterize his spells.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There is an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Throughout the record, there is unusual eye movement artifact, with very high amplitude eye artifact and somewhat asymmetric eye movements. These movements are lower amplitude on the right side, notably at the F8 lead.  The activity from the left temporal area also seems to be of greater amplitude.  There is also a suspicion of delta activity at F7 to T3.  Features of drowsiness include wicket activity, slow rolling eye movements, and an increase in beta.  Vertex waves are seen in stage I sleep.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in the amplitude of the background.   Photic stimulation elicits minimal driving.
HR:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
The presence of delta in the left frontotemporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In view of the asymmetric eye movement artifact described above, this EEG should be repeated capturing stage II sleep.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG and two channels of muscle monitoring. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric, continuous, and fairly well organized for age.  There is a 10 Hz, 40 V posterior dominant alpha rhythm, which is attenuated with eyes opened. There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, which transiently increases the slow activity of theta in the frontocentral region and returns back to baseline within one minute in post-hyperventilation. Photic stimulation elicits driving.  Following photic stimulation, POSTS are seen indicating light sleep, but no abnormal discharges were identified.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In apparent wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow for a child of this age with rhythmic 3 to 5 Hz activity and a posterior dominant rhythm, which is more typically on the order of 3 Hz, as well as a bit more background slowing than one would expect.  There are rare, high amplitude left frontocentral spike and slow wave complexes. Features of drowsiness include hypersynchronous slowing.  At times, there are more subtle underlying sharp waves from the left centrotemporal region.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a child of this age due to:
Background slowing.
Rare left frontocentral spike and slow wave complexes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing is a non-specific finding and can be seen in a postictal state, although the child does appear awake and quite interactive.  The left frontocentral spike and slow wave activity is rare, but is high amplitude and well defined.  Correlation with imaging and clinical history may be valuable.  In addition, there is a suggestion of some underlying sharp activity from the left temporal region and ongoing evaluation of that potential underlying focus may also be appropriate.

Hyperventilation is performed with poor effort, but does seem to produce both generalized rhythmic frontal slowing, as well as accentuating some of the focal slowing from the left.  Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving.
HR:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing and poor organization.
Superimposed focal slowing from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record, however, given the amount of muscle artifact noted in the background, if epileptiform activity is of importance, a repeat sleep record may be necessary.  No periodic changes were seen.  In this individual who was evaluated for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, not all individuals demonstrate the characteristic pseudoperiodic findings initially and additional studies over a 12 week period may be necessary.

Description:
During very brief wakefulness the background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm,
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present
during very brief wakefulness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity,
frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes
intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and
symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Hyperventilation is not performed.

Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL briefly awake and mostly asleep 23-minute portable EEG due to mild

nonspecific, but in this patient is at least partially secondary to excessive drowsiness.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

10 Hz alpha rhythm, generous beta activity and occasional bursts of frontal delta. Features of
drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.    A seizure emanating from the left anterior temporal   region is identified at 9:35:56 lasting 44 seconds.   The patient is noted to shift with eye blinking.  There are some automatisms and blinking associated with this.   The seizure ends abruptly with little in the way of postictal change other than more of a low voltage beta pattern.  The activity from the left temporal region is primarily theta frequency.  After the seizure ends, the patient starts to reach purposefully with his right.
The postictal recording is remarkable for occasional shifting arrhythmic delta, a bit more remarkable from the left frontal region than the right.
Photic stimulation does not activate the record. HR:  120BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1 .     A left anterior temporal focal seizure.
2.   Intermittent left temporal focal slowing.
3.   Excess beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Testing was not performed during the seizure, but it did appear to be clinically significant with some automatisms, which may have been difficult to distinguish in this confused adult.

History:	63 year old man with a history of seizures. His PMH is also notable for head trauma, a prior alcohol and drug abuse, renal dysfunction.
Medications:	Keppra, sertraline Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, bitemporal theta and delta activity become prominent. This activity then progresses to diffuse bursts of of somewhat rhythmic delta activity.
No clear focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.

Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22-minute EEG, awake and drowsy. No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.

INTRODUCTION: One hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, background EEG is well organized with generous background beta and a posterior dominant rhythm of 10 hertz, 40 to 50 microvolts. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and does produce some focal delta
from the left hemisphere with a reasonably generous field of spread including centrotemporal region. The drowsy record which follows hyperventilation also demonstrates some focal slowing from the left hemisphere including left centrotemporal. This is seen briefly and other portions of the record demonstrate a symmetric, drowsy pattern with vertex waves and posts. K-complexes and posts are observed in stage 2 sleep. Photic stimulation elicits no bilateral driving.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to rare bursts of focal slowing identified in wakefulness/early drowsiness and accentuated by hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are identified. The focal slowing is in the same region as this individual's CNS lesion.

Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Background voltages are low.  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low voltage beta activity that attenuates with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV,  18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  The majority of the background consists of low amplitude diffuse beta activity.   During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.   During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.   Frequent positive sharp waves occur bilaterally and independently in the occipital regions during drowsiness  and light sleep.
Occasional low voltage sharp waves are seen over the left fronto-temporal region (Fp1/F7/F3). A benign variant (BETS, benign epileptiform transients of sleep) cannot entirely be excluded.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates. A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate 54 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, occasional, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal 1-hour awake and asleep EEG due to: 1. Left frontotemporal sharp waves (Fp1/F7/F3). While these sharp waves are most likely epileptiform, a benign variant (BETS) cannot entirely be excluded. Of note, low voltage backgrounds are a benign variant in the adult population.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. The patient had a coughing spell while in the lab.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG is well­ organized with 9.5, Hz 50, 50-70 microvolts posterior dominant rhythm. A normal variant is observed in the background with rhythmic mid temporal, 5 Hz activity in the temporal regions, right or left. The technologist tested the patient on multiple occasions with stimulation of the patient always terminates these strains at 5 Hz flat top shaped activity, which may be unilateral or bilaterally.
At 11: 30: 54: The patient is sitting comfortably and has a heart rate of 84. She has a coughing spell, feeling as if she cannot catch her breath, and as if she is about to lose contact. The coughing spell is associated with muscle movement artifact, followed by burst of high amplitude delta. The heart rate increases to 132 beats per minute.
By 11:31:44: the EEG has returned to normal, but the patient remains tachycardic and feels unwell. Additional coughing again produces some of the same artifact, and some burst of delta.
Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response. HR: 	84-132 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   The rhythmic mid temporal theta described above is a normal variant, sometimes referred to as psychomotor variant. The patient had 2 episodes of coughing, with an increase in delta. The physiologic conclusion would be that prolonged coughing is the results in a hyperventilation response with the same sort of entity as would be expected to see in hyperventilation in the lab.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement  with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, background  EEG demonstrates an interhemispheric asymmetry. The left hemisphere is appropriately  organized with 9 Hz 50 mV posterior dominant rhythm. The right hemisphere  is characterized  by intermittent arrhythmic delta. Although, much of the faster frequency activity persists with periodic, right centrotemporal sharp waves with a field of spread essentially throughout the entire right hemisphere. These vary in terms of the periodicity, but do not evolve to seizures. If the patient becomes drowsy, they become lower amplitude with more a pattern of sharply contoured delta. Deeper stages of sleep are characterized  by an increase in beta frequency activity. The patient is easily
stimulated with an awake pattern from the left and a periodic sharply contoured  slowing from the
right.
HR: 	96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram:
1. 	Right-sided focal slowing.
2. 	Periodic, high-amplitude  right temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORR ELATION:
This EEG supports a structural abnormality  on the right involving
gray and white matter. The periodic sharp waves support cortical irritability. This is a highly irritative pattern that raises concerns for ongoing seizures.  These results were reviewed with clinical team on 10/12/2007.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are preformed. This is a 1 hour Sleep-Deprived EEG. Left craniotomy defect is observed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 hertz posterior dominant rhythm. A prominent craniotomy defect is observed with wicked from the left central temporal region. Underneath the wicked, there is a small amount of slow delta. Hyperventilation is performed  early on in the record accentuating the focal slowing. This is followed by drowsiness  with slow rolling eye movements. Vertex waves are observed in stage 1 sleep followed by arousals. Possible REM sleep is observed in this record in the sleep deprived 1 hour record with a characteristic  theta and lateral eye movements in a past who does not appear to be awake. This may have been associated with an arousal. An EMG monitor was not employed. In the extended sleep recording, there is vertex activity. There is alpha frequency activity picked up on the left more so that the right into stage 2 sleep which is an unusual finding in that is it sometimes seen on the right would not be considered a clearly pathological entity. Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.
HR: 	54 bpm
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Intermittent focal slowing particularly observed in drowsiness in the left central temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are a number of unusual features in this record including the possibility of REM sleep in a single 1 hour record. The REM sleep appeared to be fragmented.  Another usual feature was the presence of rhythmic alpha rhythmic activity from the left central temporal region into stage 2 sleep.
This could not be considered clearly pathological  as it was sometimes present on there right. In any case, the alpha frequency activity did not wax and wane as might be anticipated in an epileptiform  pathology
Given the presence of the metal plate, epileptiform  activity may be under recognized in this individual. The previous craniotomy and skull defect in this case provide a breech rhythm with accentuation of activity, but the possibility of that activity is masked could not be excluded. This individual did not experience any other his paroxysmal spells during the study.

performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing and increase in amplitude of the background as well as some rhythmic delta from the right hemisphere, but without disruption of the underlying faster frequency activity. As the patient becomes drowsy again, there is a subtle disruption of faster frequency activity with subtle rhythmic slowing in the right temporal region. This is seen with brief transitions into stage II sleep but deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. On one occasion, in the transition to sleep there are sharp waves with rhythmic slowing out of the right temporal region followed by an arousal period. Unfortunately, there is some wick-like activity at this same time and there are some additional more subtle sharp waves without the same faster frequency activity noted. Photic stimulation elicits a bilateral driving response. During photic stimulation, a well defined right anterotemporal spike in slow-wave complex is observed. Additional spike complexes are noted at the very end of the record, again right anterotemporal.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE As the tracing opens, the patient is relatively lethargic, but
over the course of this postictal EEG, the patient is more arousable. The initial background is
low voltage, diffusely slow, but there are intermittent arousals with approximately 8 Hertz alpha
rhythm identified bilaterally right better than left. The patient waxes and wanes with some
portions of the records which are reasonably well organized with alpha and theta activity, other
which are low voltage featureless delta and others which are a mix of irregular mixed theta and
delta. Activity is slightly higher on the right. Through the course of the record, intermittent
attenuations are observed and there is a fair amount of waxing and waning although the close -
of the record does seem to be better then the beginning. There is some sharp slowing observed
in the right mid to anterior temporal region with an after going slow wave observed.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Superimposed focal slowing with disruption of fast frequency on the left relative to the right.
3. Intermittent background attenuation.
4. Rare sharp wave observed on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function
effecting both hemispheres perhaps more significantly on the left than the right. The sharp
waves, however, were on the right. No previous EEG were available for comparison.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The wakeful background EEG demonstrated well
organized alpha arrhythmia at 10.5 Hz per second. Drowsiness is characterized by
slow eye roaming movement, increasing slowly in the theta range. Deeper status of
sleep is characterized by bunch of vertex wave K complex spindle and POST.
Hyperventilation increasing background amplitude and also slightly inducing
background slowing. Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.

INTRODUCTION:   Digital EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed, this is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness  there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Hyperventilation is performed early on a new record.  Hyperventilation seems
to elicit some 13-14Hz activity similar to 14 and 6.  As hyperventilation continues, there are paroxysmal bursts of slowing.  In addition, as the activity continues, high amplitude bursts of paroxysmal 3-4 Hz activity is observed.  Some of these are notched and some of these have a definitive, sharpened slow wave complex.  Preceding some of these waveforms in wakefulness, in some montages there is a suggestion of a vertex wave. Features of drowsiness included increase in beta. Photic stimulation is remarkable for a vigorous driving response.
HR: 	90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to
1. 	3 Hz frontally predominant spike in wave activity in hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are supportive of an inherited mechanism for epilepsy.  There are some -slight atypical features but overall they are within the range of normal for a generalized epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was attempted, but not completed at the patient's request.  Photic stimulation was completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  The waking background is intermittently interrupted by rhythmic theta which can be diffuse, frontocentral bilateral.  There are also shifting asymmetries noted.  The patient transitions rapidly in and out of stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.  In the transition in and out of sleep, rare mu activity was identified.  There is also some sharply contoured slowing in the frontocentral regions bilaterally.

Photic stimulation is performed as the patient transitions in and out of stage 2 sleep.  Scant driving was noted.  Heart rate 84 BPM with occasional PVCs.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1. Intermittent excess theta.
2. Mild background disorganization.
3. Occasional bursts of frontally predominant sharply contoured slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This individual had difficult relaxing during the study.  If additional information is needed to localize this patient's epilepsy, a more prolonged sleep study may be considered.  Additional evaluation for this patient's PVCs may be warranted.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG in wakefulness includes a great deal of muscle movement artifact, but there is also a well defined, 10 hertz alpha rhythm of 30-50 microvolts. There is some sharply contoured theta observed in the background with a suspicious sharp wave seen early on which is difficult to localize. During hyperventilation there is an increase in amplitude, as well as an increase in activity at
the vertex again. With the use of a circle montage, there is again this question of a vertex  sharp wave observed when the patient has not reached the appropriate stages of sleep in which vertex pathology is normally seen. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. In addition, there is a bit of shifting slowing seen around that time in the centrotemporal regions.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Disorganized background with non-appreciable posterior alpha rhythm. Background  shows a slow theta pattern throughout. At times in the record there are occasional periodic discharges seen in both hemispheres but of a greater intensity on the left. They are located mostly in the left parietal region and in the same region on the right and some are seen also in the temporal regions. These are not regular occurrences in the record and the patient returns to more of that slow theta pattern as it continues. During the record the patient is stimulated with an increase in muscle artifact and minimal response on the record of alertness. On the video there is some twitching seen of the left forearm, but there is no correlated EEG activity at this time in the record.

HR: 	66 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Slowing of the background  with mostly a theta pattern bilaterally; occasionally  delta.
2. 	Periodic discharges seen with the left greater than right maximum which occasionally occurs on the record.

CLINICAL  CORRELATION:  Arm twitching is seen on the video and is not consistent an EEG correlation for epilepsy. The periodic discharges are occasional and with a little bit more reactivity on the left than the right. This could be consistent with either structural damage or an encephalopathy  picture as well as the slowing of the background which is a non-specific  finding.

Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal

Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the right temporooccipital region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm was 9-10 Hz in frequency 30-50 microvolts in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Stage 1 and stage 2 sleep are characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm and slowing of the background and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact, and presence of posts, K complexes, vertex sharp transients, and sleep spindles.  There are also intermittent bursts of bitemporal slowing at F7/T3 and F8/T4 lasting for 1-2 seconds.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies, and results in a symmetric driving response.  Hyperventilation was performed and resulted in slowing of the background activity.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through drowsiness due to bitemporal slowing.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Bitemporal slowing is suggestive of bilateral structural abnormalities or bilateral cerebral dysfunction.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record.  No seizures are captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures. If clinically indicated, a repeat EEG or continuous bedside EEG or ambulatory, an EEG monitoring maybe helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   In wakefulness, there is an 11.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with 50 microvolts with a small amount of low-voltage frontal/ central beta activity. In drowsiness,  there is rare, subtle, left antero-temporal theta. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record, very slightly eliciting some theta which is again slightly more prominent in the left frontotemporal/ fronto-central region. Features of drowsiness include slow-rolling eye movements. Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving. The patient is starting to transition in and out of stage 2 sleep during photic stimulation. Towards the close of the record on a handful of occasions the theta seems to have an underlying discrete sharp wave, but there is no definitive of sharp and slow-wave complex observed.

INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20

This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm of 40
microvolts. There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.
Intermittent, rhythmic bursts of medium amplitude, approximately 4 Hz activity is
observed with rhythmic discharges seen in relaxed wakefulness. These seem to come
and go throughout the record. Testing is not performed during the EEG but the rhythmic
4Hz activity seems to wax and wane on its own. Sustained sleep was not achieved. In
transition to drowsiness there were a handful of bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta.
Photic stimulation demonstrates a driving response but at the same time arrhythmic 4
Hz activity also appears, not related to the photic driving response. When the photic
driving response is present it does seem to eliminate the rhythmic theta.

INTRODUCTION:  Extended, digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  The patient was somewhat symptomatic during the EEG, reporting disequilibrium.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the EEG demonstrates an awake pattern with a symmetric reactive alpha rhythm.  This is disrupted by intermittent bursts of rhythmic right temporal delta with admixed sharp waves.  The bursts of sharp waves and delta are on the order of 5-10-15 seconds in duration.  No alteration in the patient's motor or sensory symptoms were seen in association with these discharges.  The patient's responses are slowed, but the tech who spends 40 minutes with the patient, finds that the patient's responsiveness is not so significantly different than the sections of the record without the bursts.  As the recording concludes, the epileptiform activity is decreasing, but there remains some rhythmic right temporal slowing.  The sharp waves are significantly more discreet.
Photic stimulation was performed at the end of the record.  A driving response was identified.  In the final minutes of the recording, another more brief burst of right temporal sharp waves was noted.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Well-defined high amplitude right temporal sharp waves.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard  10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.	The patient had just come from the emergency room having received the Dilantin and he had a seizure in the EEG lab removing his EEG electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the recording starts out, the patient is awake and reasonably cooperative.  There is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm observed. As the tracing again, the patient is awake with a 9.5 Hz, 30 mV posterior dominate rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by
slow-rolling eye movements. Hyperventilation is initiated early in the record, at 13:30 the patient is in the middle of hyperventilation.  At this time, 13:30:50 there is an arousal.   This is followed by the appearance of beta at 13:30:55, with repetitive sharp activity and theta maximum in the left temporal region, but with some bilateral representation.  As this continues at 13:31:07, there is little in the way of clinical manifestations.  By 13:31:10, the patient is starting to look from side to side.  He looks somewhat startled or frightened. The technologist calls the patient.  The patient's is
observed to be chewing, at 13:31:20, with repetitive sharp waves in left temporal region. He seems to be having automatic movements, face and but the audio is not
discernable.  The EEG goes on to be obscured with muscle.  As the patient's behaviors change, at 13:31:44, as he does that he has had head turning to the right. He gets up, he rotating around and looking all the way to the right.  He starts to turn around and around and he puts his head down. At that point, he rolls back towards his back and he has tonic clonic activity with his back to the camera with tonic stiffening and then clonic by 13:32:05. he seems to be having tonic clonic activity in the right arm but the left arm is stiff. Foaming at the mouth is seen at 13:32:19.  while he has eye deviation to the left he is jerking primarily with the right arm.  The characteristic slow pattern at the close of the clonic tonic seizure as the motor activity slows, is observed at 13:32:39. This seizure  ends at 13:32:48.  This is a 2 minute seizure.  Afterwards, the patient is awake, but agitated and he starts to get up and move about. There is a caregiver present with the technologist who applies oxygen.  The patient removes all the electrodes and receives 4 mg of Ativan. The EEG concludes at 13:40:02, where behaviorally the
patient is postictal

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  At the start of this record you see a markedly abnormal EEG.  The left hemisphere shows a low voltage, slow and suppressed background.  There is an asymmetry with the right hemisphere showing regular polyspike activity in the P4, T4, T6 regions.  Overall there is an extensive spread of activity that seemed to continue throughout this record. There is no seizure activity seen in this record even with extensive epileptiform discharges coming from the right hemisphere. There is some suppression of the record in between the discharges sometimes lasting up to 3 seconds.

HR:	78 bpm and irregular

IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Left hemispheric suppression over the background.
Continuous right hemispheric polyspike activity with the parietal and temporal regions with a large field of spread.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:   There is no seizure activity recorded on this record, however, the regular polyspike activity in the right hemisphere shows the patient have a very irritative focus for seizure activity. The suppression of the left hemisphere can be consistent with a history of previous stroke in the past.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel  EKG. Patient is somnolent but moving about and answering questions.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a slow pattern bilaterally with theta-delta pattern.  In addition, superimposed upon this is a rhythmic delta from the right posterior quadrant and in this region there is also a sharp wave in the right posterotemporal region.

The patient has a seizure while working with the tech. The seizure seems to begin while the tech is working with the patient and the first ictal changes are at 15:48. The ictal changes include an increase in theta frequency activity.

By 01:49:00 very clear ictal changes are noted with the patient looking, instead of at the right, he is looking at the left and blinking. He remains responsive to the technologist at
0:48:55 as this activity builds up.  He seems to be confused, but he does follow commands and closes his eyes at 0:49:14. The tech is working with the patient so she does not observe the rhythmic repetitive theta activity in the right temporal region which spreads to the parietal and occipital region as well. He stops speaking, though.  By
15:50 the physician comes to examine the patient who is clearly confused and unable to follow commands, with roving eye movements.   He does provide a few words at
15:50:33. This electrographic seizure has a clear end at 15:51:11 and likely onset gradual evolution of faster frequencies at 15:48 for a total seizure duration of approximately 3 minutes.

Afterwards, the EEG returns to its previous, slower periodic sharp wave from the right hemisphere which gradually build up at 15:54:03.   Facial twitching is noted.

The second seizure is a grand mal seizure but starts with facial twitching and actually has a complex partial component where the patient actually seems to be somewhat

responsive and uncomfortable with focal and then asynchronous twitching. The second seizure is significantly longer in duration.  The tonic-clonic section of it is still relatively prolonged and is at least4  seconds in duration.

After the second seizure which has the tonic-clonic components, the overall EEG is quite slow but the periodic complexes in the right posterior quadrant persist.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG demonstrates an intrahemispheric  asymmetry.  There is a discernible 9Hz 50 microvolt alpha rhythm on the right which is disrupted on the left.  In addition, there is a skull defect with head rocking in the right central region and overall disruption of mu activity on the right compared to the left. Features of drowsiness include a drop out of faster frequency activity which occurs on the right much sooner on the left.
A seizure occurs at 09:53:03. It begins with the subtle development of alpha frequency out of the right temporal scalp electrodes which evolve.  No definitive clinical signs are seen until 09:53:47 when he starts to blink.  He seems to be motionless looking at the camera.  There may be some switching in the neck, but nothing that the video observer can see.  By 09:53:47 he is staring and blinking, looking to the left.  There is clear frequency evolution at 09:54:37.  There is no testing performed in the seizure and postictal slowing is noted with the end of the seizure occurring at 09:55:22 to 09:56.  By
09:59 the EEG looks postictal.  It has returned to the slowing that was previously noted
on the right with the return of alpha briefly on the left.
Notable features during this relatively prolonged, 2 minute complex partial seizure, includes the appearance of alpha frequency activity bilaterally, although there previously had not been alpha frequency on the right.  This activity is clearly pathological and it is not the alpha rhythm which reacts to eye opening.  It is actually faster frequency than it is posterior dominant rhythm and it is associated with repetitive sharp activity at T2.
The postictal recording includes some sharp waves on the left.

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG was performed  at bedside using 10-20 system of electrode placement  with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is recorded in a routine room.
There is no seizure spike detection employed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Through the course of this EEG, there are 6 complex partial seizures recorded.  The clinical manifestations of the seizures appear to be quite subtle for those who are not familiar with epilepsy.  The patient stares, blinks, may look to the left, and has impaired responsiveness.  He has some automatic movements.
Epileptiform activity during the seizures is characterized  by rhythmic 9 Hz activity in the right temporal region, including the right posterior temporal region.  This activity shows frequency evolution transitioning  to theta and then delta with sharply contoured activity at T2, T4, and T6. Postictal features for these seizures include marked slowing from the right hemisphere, particularly the temporal region with rhythmic theta delta, and then a lower voltage more suppressed pattern.
The seizures are relatively infrequent, but reoccur at 16:20, 16:43.  That seizure is characterized by chewing activity,  02:28 to 02:48 in which there is really little in the way of clinical correlate, but there is the clear alpha frequency activity on the right with a slower pattern on the left, 03:06,
04:52, 05:09. Some of the discharges  have little in the way of a clinical correlate. The recording ends at 6:00 a.m.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
I.   Multiple complex partial seizures, but they seem to be abating at the close of the record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The EEG supports an irritative process on the right.  The complex partial seizures are relatively subtle.  The total number of seizures is likely 6-8 in 15 hours.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic simulation is performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The beginning of the record shows marked intrahemispheric asymmetry.  The right hemisphere  is much slower and is featureless.  The left looks close to normal with a 9.5 Hz, 50 microvolt alpha rhythm.  There are areas of T2 T4 arrhythmic slowing, as well as sharply contoured waves in the same region. Photic stimulation is performed  and produces shifting slowing from the T2 T4 region and shifts to the T4 T6 region. There appears to be a small driving response on the left, but not on the right with photic stimulation.

HR:   66 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG, but improved when compared to prior in November 2009:
1. 	intrahemispheric asymmetry.  There is sharply contoured rhythmic slowing waves on the right.
2. 	The left is much improved.
3. 	There are no sharp waves on the left.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra off, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, Percocet p.r.n., and nicotine patch.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  The patient was on continuous audio video EEG monitoring.  The patient was provided with an event button.  Nursing staff notes and medical house staff notes were reviewed.  Spike detection and seizure detection were activated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 10.5 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.
During sleep symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, K-complexes, slow wave sleep, and REM sleep are captured.
The patient was artificially sleep deprived until approximately 3:00 a.m. on 12/23/2012.  There is an electrode artifact early in the recording in multiple electrodes.  After approximately 1:00 p.m. there is a continuous Fp1 electrode artifact, and by the end of the recording electrode artifact is observed in several electrodes.  Electrode artifact may limit interpretation of the EEG during those periods.

Description:
Waking background is characterized by low-to-moderate amplitude 10.5-11 Hz alpha rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-
7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Polymorphic and rhythmic delta activity (TIRDA) is frequently observed over the left temporal
region during wakefulness and increases during drowsiness.  Two focal electrographic seizures are
captured.  Each lasts ~ 1 minute.  No clinical correlate is reported by the EEG technologist.  The
patient is not formally tested during these seizures.  They occur during drowsiness.  Seizures start
with rhythmic left anterior temporal delta activity, most pronounced over F7/t1 region.  It gradually
increases in amplitude, becomes more prominent and slightly increases in frequency from ~2 Hz to
~2.5-3 Hz.  There is some reflection  to the left parasagittal leads and left lateral/ temporal leads.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.

This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 28-minute EEG due to intermittent focal left anterior
temporal slowing, often rhythmic, and 2 focal left anterior temporal seizures that occur during
drowsiness and do not have a clear clinical correlate. These findings are indicative of an
epileptogenic focus in left anterior temporal region, and given the clinical history of partial

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is actually increasingly awake and responsive during the EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is remarkable for a fair amount of muscle movement artifact. There is a beta frequency background on the left with generous beta.  There is irregular activity in the right hemisphere with arrhythmic delta activity with variable maximum, including frontal temporal, posterior temporal, or right central/central temporal.  Arrhythmic delta accompanies this. Later portions in the record, when the patient is a bit more awake, seem to be associated with a bit less of this activity, but it  is relatively continuous.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due:
1.	Generalized background slowing.
2.	Superimposed focal slowing on the right.
3. 	Sharp waves from the right, including right central temporal.


CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	This EEG supports a highly irritative focus in the right hemisphere.  Given the fever, nuchal rigidity, and abnormal CSF, these findings should be interpreted in the context of clinical and imaging data.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and sleep study.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  During wakefulness, there is a disorganized background. The posterior dominant rhythm reaches at the start 6 Hz and up to 35 microvolts. As the record continues and patient reaches maximal wakefulness during stimulation, the background rhythm reaches at its maximum 9 Hz. There is an interhemispheric asymmetry seen with some focal slowing of the right hemisphere.  Sleep is seen with vertex waves and spindles and a little epochs of sleep, where the patient quickly awakens.  Hyperventilation accentuates the focal slowing in the right hemisphere.  Photic stimulation shows some scant driving, which is seen a bit better on the right posterior hemisphere.
HR:  66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Generalized slowing of the background, which does reach 9 Hz, but the majority of the background is slow.
2. 	More focal slowing seen in the right hemisphere.
Scant driving seen asymmetrically  and better in the right posterior region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is no epileptiform activity seen in this record. The generalized slowing of the background is nonspecific.  Initially, the focal slowing is seen in the right hemisphere,  but the driving is actually better in the right hemisphere,  which is incongruent and not initially expected.  The focal differences could be secondary to a structural abnormality and could get imaging this patient.  Clinical correlation is recommended.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  The EKG electrode does not show a very good rhythm, a very low amplitude rhythm.  In addition, the impedances on the occipital electrodes and the right frontal and central electrodes were very high due to difficulty with the patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a recording that is mainly in sleep.  The patient is aroused at one point during the study and there appears to be a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8 Hz, mainly seen over the right hemisphere, but for a short duration, again in the setting of electrode with a high impedance.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  The EKG electrode does not show a very good rhythm, a very low amplitude rhythm.  In addition, the impedances on the occipital electrodes and the right frontal and central electrodes were very high due to difficulty with the patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a recording that is mainly in sleep.  The patient is aroused at one point during the study and there appears to be a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8 Hz, mainly seen over the right hemisphere, but for a short duration, again in the setting of electrode with a high impedance.

Abnormal discharges:
Focal slow waves seen frequently at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-50 mV, at times with a very sharply contoured component.  Sometimes they appear to become rhythmic, but not clearly evolved or become continuous.
Focal slowing seen intermittently at T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
Mild excessive theta in wakefulness and limited wakefulness.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal focal slowing, as well as right mid temporal focal slowing and mild excessive theta in limited wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG in limited wakefulness reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region and independently in the right mid temporal region, both of which are nonspecific in regards to etiology.  In addition, the patient appears to have some mild diffuse generalized dysfunction, which is also nonspecific in regard to etiology.  No seizures or clear epileptiform discharges were seen.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is a one-hour sleep-deprived record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a well-organized background with 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient rapidly drifts in and out of sleep with POSTS. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, but the patient is drifting
into stage II  sleep. Spikey POSTS are observed in the abundant stage II  sleep record. In  the sleep recording, there is an amplitude asymmetry for the POSTS which are high amplitude and on one occasion a left parietal sharp wave.  Additionally, with this subtle asymmetry there is also noted asymmetry with more muscle artifact on the right. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is essentially asleep and does not significantly activate the record.

HR:	78 bpm


IMPRESSION: Questionably abnormal EEG due to:
1.  A single left parietal sharp wave.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:   The amplitude asymmetry of the POSTS is an acceptable variant. A single sharp wave is a nonspecific finding. It may represent artifact, and there are other artifacts noted in this record at this time.

There is 5-7 Hz diffuse theta activity noted during wakefulness.  There is attenuation and loss of faster frequencies in the right hemisphere, most pronounced in posterior quadrant with intermittent slowing in the left cerebral hemisphere.  The lethargic state is characterized by further slowing of the background and disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm.  Heart rate was 90 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal EEG recording due to:
Diffuse slowing of the background with theta activity seen in wakefulness.
Slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
Attenuation and loss of faster frequencies and also slowing in the left posterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings are suggestive of either metabolic, toxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of sedating medication or bilateral cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  Attenuation and loss of faster frequencies in the left cerebral hemisphere is likely due to the patient's history of stroke.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record.

HISTORY:
A 37-year-old female who presents for followup EEG with past medical history significant for generalized epilepsy. Last seizure was reported in February 2011, with fall and loss of consciousness with urinary incontinence and postictal confusion lasting for an hour.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
Posterior dominant alpha rhythm is seen at 9 to 10Hz frequency and 20 microvolt amplitude which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. Frontocentral beta rhythm is also seen. Stage I sleep is seen and is normal. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed, which are also normal.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  the patient is very anxious with frequent eye blinking.  This is an awake EEG with photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is scant 8 Hz activity identified in the background.  There are sections of the record in which the alpha seems to be almost invariant on the right.  When the patient relaxes and the eye blinks stops, there is a clear asymmetry with disruption of the alpha rhythm on the left in comparison to the right, excess theta in the left hemisphere, and occasional left anterior temporal sharp and slow wave complexes.  These occur as the patient reaches stage I sleep. Photic stimulation occurs while the patient is blinking vigorously.  There is scant driving.

INTRODUCTION: Digital Video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a vigorous, 50-70 microvolt 10 Hertz upper rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, fronto-central beta activity. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude data background. Photic stimulation elicits harmonic and spur harmonic driving. As the photic stimulation begins the patient looks to the left and covers her face. She has her hands over her eyes and appears to be crying. When the technologist turns towards the patient at 10:18:08 the technologist interacts with the patient who begins to have jerking. The patient exhibits pelvic thrusting and neck thrusting and involuntary jerkins. The jerking of the right arm persists even as the study ends at 10:21 but the patient is able to look and interact with the physician. The EEG demonstrates a normal awake pattern throughout the entire event. There is no spike in wave activity and a well defined alpha rhythm is observed.

Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation is performed from 1-7 fps. It is aborted early because patient has an event early during photic stimulation. Event lasts - 90 seconds and has no abnormal EEG correlate.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Some sections of the records are well organized with rhythmic 8 Hz alpha rhythm, others demonstrate a little bit more disorganization with rhythmic slowing, particularly in the posterior regions. This is accentuated by hyperventilation. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta, again with slight accentuation of the theta seen in the posterior regions, somewhat left more so than the right. Vertex waves are observed in stage 1 sleep. Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response, although the patient is drifting off to sleep. Vertex waves are noted at the close of photic stimulation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 30 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm, a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity,
and a small amount of frontal theta. The frontal theta is overall symmetric but with a
slight asymmetry. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial sections of much of the waking record unfortunately includes head rocking artifact in the posterior regions. There is a 10.5 hertz alpha rhythm which is higher amplitude on the right than the left and posterior activity is always higher amplitude on the right than the left in this individual. Brief stage II sleep includes vertex waves, spindles and POSTS.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, but the overall background is somewhat disorganized.  There is a small amount of shifting slowing and a small amount of background theta.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic theta.  Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
Notable in this record are paroxysmal bursts of rhythmic, high amplitude theta, some of which demonstrate frequency evolution.  In addition, there are irregular bursts of 4-5 Hz spike and wave activity noted in the frontal regions.  On occasion, some of these seem to be a bit more prominent in the right.  These bursts are overall, relatively asynchronous.
Hyperventilation produced 1 of these bursts of high amplitude, theta frequency activity with a questionable right frontal spike and slow wave complex as well as some rhythmic theta.

INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was preformed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient keeps a log. He is able to push the button for all of the events that he experiences. He has multiple episodes of dizziness or disorienting feeling.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 hertz posterior dominant rhythm which is symmetrically reactive. Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background theta with vertex waves, spindles and stage II sleep. There is an epoch in which REM sleep is seen.
In the interictal EEG, there is a single left temporal sharp wave.
Events: The patient has multiple dizzy spells including 129, 125, 312, 336, 536, 546 and then there are no additional push buttons noted.
Although not all of the seizures have a clear clinical correlate and some have only either subtle theta or subtle disruption of faster frequency activity in left temporal region, some have clear, rhythmic 4 hertz theta from the left temporal region with some spread to the frontocentral region bilaterally, typically lasting 20-40 seconds. The patient receives Depakote at 2:20p.m., the discharges are briefer, more evanescent more allusive.
Event time 12930: the patient has a dizzy spell characterized by decreased alpha frequency activity from the left temporal region and a brief burst of left temporal theta.
Event time: 2:32 p.m.: There is a brief burst of left temporal theta which differs from the background.
Event time: 3:12p.m.: Aura of dizziness, left temporal theta.
Event #3: Aura characterized by dizziness time 335 to 33729, rhythmic temporal theta as described above.
Event #4: Subtle left temporal theta at 3:53:52.
Event #5: 536, very subtle left temporal theta.
Event #6: Aura 5:46:13, brief burst of left temporal theta.
HR: 100 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG monitoring due to:
1. Subtle, intermittent attenuation of alpha frequency activity in the left temporal region.
2. A handful of well defined auras characterized by rhythmic 4 hertz theta with clear frequency evolution. The characteristic seizure pattern for this patient includes attenuation of alpha in the region, then the theta and then some bilateral frontocentral spread.
3. Rare interictal findings including sharp waves in the left temporal region and sharply contoured theta. An example of this is at 4:35:37 a.m. on the morning of the second.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of a localization related
mechanism for epilepsy. These findings were reviewed with the patient during the hospitalization.

Beta rhythm is also seen with 15-25 Hz frequency and 10-15 microvolt amplitude in the frontal central region in small amounts.  Stage 1 and stage 2 sleep records are also seen. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are normal.  There is focal slowing noted at F8, T4, and T4 electrodes of 2-4 Hz frequency and 20-70 microvolt amplitude, however, seen occasionally.  No seizures are seen.
HR:  N/A
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Occasional focal slowing seen in the right mid and anterior temporal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with focal cerebral dysfunction in the right temporal lobe which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake record with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9Hz, 40 microvolt posterior-dominant rhythm. The alpha rhythm is sometimes disrupted from the right hemisphere. There is some shifting arrhythmic delta activity identified bilaterally. High amplitude right anterior temple spike and slow wave complexes are observed most of which are maximum at T-2 but some of which are maximum T4 and T6. All are high amplitude, sometimes exceeding 100 microvolts with a generous field of spread within the right hemisphere and disruption of faster
frequency activity. Hyperventilation clearly accentuates the epileptiform activity. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. There is some bilateral posterior slowing and drowsiness. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. The focal right greater than left posterior slowing is noted in photic stimulation. Stage I sleep starts to emerge at the end of the EEG but sleep is not sustained.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. High amplitude right anterior temporal spike and slow wave complexes.
2. Right hemisphere and right temporal focal slowing.
3. Sharp waves in the right hemisphere with variable maximum but most of which are maximum in the temple regions
4. A modest degree of background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings support a structural process as well as a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is remarkably low voltage with a 9.7 hertz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta. Mu rhythm is noted, but testing is not performed to confirm this. The Mu activity is 10 hertz. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Vertex waves are observed in stage I sleep. The vertex waves are to the right of the midline. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.

INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the emergency room using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement
with one channel of EKG. The patient is examined during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
The background EEG begins With a marked asymmetry between the two hemispheres. It is very low-voltage suppressed
with a paucity of beta activity on the left. In contrast, the right includes generous beta, diffusely. In this relatively
low-voltage pattern on the left, there are subtle, periodic sharp waves or sharply contoured delta at C3-P3. As the
recording continues, the patient is starting to move about, there is additional beta activity noted from both hemispheres.
The periodic complexes are still apparent underneath the muscle and movement artifact. Stimulation of the patient
produces an increase in muscle artifact. As the recording continues, the epileptiform activity transitions to a bit more of a
frontotemporal broadly contoured discharge with a broad field of spread.
Heart rate 104 BPM.

IMPRESSION:
Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1.
Initially, a markedly slow and suppressed pattern on the left.
2.
An asymmetry that persists throughout the record with a much slower pattern on the left.
3.
A periodic complex seen intermittently from the left. The patient was a bit more agitated by the end of the record, but
on the video, no jerking can be discerned during the video to correlate with the periodic complexes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
In this individual with recent seizures characterized by right-sided jerking, the periodic complexes and focal slowing should
be correlated with imaging to exclude a structural pathology. No prolonged seizures were recorded.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement as well as anterotemporal electrodes and EKG electrodes.  The EEG was recorded with photic stimulation and hyperventilation was performed.  Sleep stage I and stage II were recorded.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Frequent bilateral temporalis muscle artifact seen during the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontal central beta.  Sleep stage I and stage II is recorded.  Photic stimulation and hyperventilation presented no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
There are 2 short bursts of less than 400 milliseconds seen with left frontal predominant sharp waves and slow waves which appeared to have a bilateral component and distribution more consistent with fragment of general spike and wave, however, a focal left frontal spike cannot be excluded.
SEIZURES:   None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Left frontal asymmetric spike and wave discharges likely fragments of generalized spike and wave
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with evidence of cortical irritability which is suggestive of an idiopathic generalized epilepsy.  However, the slight asymmetry of the spike and wave fragments may also suggest a focal origin with secondary bilateral synchrony.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No seizures were seen.

Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists primarily of diffuse polymorph ic theta activity with underriding beta activity and overriding prominent polymorphic slow delta activity. Right frontocentral region contains frequent subtle stereotyped runs of activity that are concerning for electrographic

INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is initially intubated. Afterwards, he is wearing a face mask. The patient is obtunded in the first section of the record and progressively more awake over time.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial sections of the record demonstrated a low voltage beta pattern particularly a frontal beta pattern and some shifting posterior in delta. There is some head rocking artifacts and sweat. Over the course of the long term monitor, stimulation of the patient starts to produce an arousal response. Later on, eye opening and eye closure is noted when someone is at the bedside with the patient and by the end of the EEG, he is intermittently awake with low voltage beta pattern. At other points, there is a somewhat slow background in wakefulness.

INTRODUCTION:  A 20 minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is quite fragile, but awake.  He is responsive to questions.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The right hemisphere is low voltage and relatively featureless.  The left hemisphere is remarkable for a craniotomy defect, but also periodic, high amplitude delta activity with a left central parietal spike and wave complex.  The spike and wave complex is periodic in nature and has the periodicity of about 8 per 10 seconds.  There is a small amount of waxing and waning of the epileptiform discharge, but no clear ictal pattern.  Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta in the left hemisphere as well as eye movement.
Heart rate:  80 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
A continuous periodic discharge, which includes a spike as well as periodic delta from the left hemisphere, maximum in the central parietal region.
Markedly slow and suppressed pattern from the right with volume conduction of the epileptiform discharge on the left to the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The patient seems to be awake and interactive despite the discharge described above.

INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with acceptable impedances, although there is a prominent craniotomy defect.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background from the right hemisphere includes a low voltage, continuous, primarily beta frequency pattern.  The left hemisphere demonstrates a prominent breach rhythm.  There are bursts of rhythmic 3 to 4 Hz activity of 1 to 3 seconds duration.  Some of these are associated with a sharp waves.  The bursts of rhythmic slowing with left mid temporal sharp waves are more prominent as the patient became drowsy.
Heart rate: 54 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
A marked interhemispheric asymmetry.
A low voltage slow pattern from the right with primarily beta frequency activity.
A pattern from the left with higher amplitude delta, a prominent reach, and a left mid temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is one of many EEGs for this adult, who has been evaluated for status epilepticus and seizures.  The epileptiform activity today is primarily left mid temporal, which in some ways is similar to the continuous EEG monitoring.  A contrast to February 2015 EEG monitor, which identified epileptiform activity from the left hemisphere, but that epileptiform activity was much more prominent in the central parietal region.
This EEG continues to support a focal mechanism for this patient's seizures.  The epileptiform activity is in the region of the patient's head trauma.  The bilateral background slowing supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively low voltage with generous beta and a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  With testing the alpha improves to 10 Hz.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  Wicket is noted in relaxed wakefulness. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record.  The patient is falling asleep during hyperventilation with vertex waves and spindles.  There are some normal variants, including small sharp spikes of sleep, but there is also some left temporal focal slowing.  The patient transitions in and out of stage II sleep.  Again, subtle left temporal focal slowing is noted.  Simple sharp waves, as are common in normal variants, are also noted in the left temporal region. These are again noted with photic stimulation.  The patient is once again falling asleep during photic stimulation.

HR:    60 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Subtle left temporal focal slowing.
2. Left temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The left temporal sharp waves have a simple morphology as can be seen in a normal variant.  However, they occur in the context of focal slowing and are more suggestive of a focal mechanism for epilepsy.  In comparison to a previous EEG, both EEGs demonstrate some of the same normal variants and some of the same unique challenges.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 2 to 4 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.  In addition, there are intermittent bursts of anterior predominant slowing at times with a triphasic morphology seen intermittently.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
Triphasics at 3-4 Hz with anterior predominance.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology; however, the presence of triphasics suggests at least the possibility of a metabolic encephalopathy.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake and briefly drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the EEG is well organized with a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm. As the patient becomes drowsy, there is somewhat asynchronous theta noted. In addition, there is a drop out of the alpha rhythm, a little faster in the left hemisphere with a little bit of slowing on the left relevant to the right. Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving with harmonic and super-harmonic driving. Super-harmonic driving is seen with faster frequency activity. Stage I sleep includes vertex waves.
HR: 60 bpm with occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1.Several asymmetries in the temporal region, particularly as the patient becomes drowsy with left greater than right temporal theta.
2. Disrupted alpha as the patient transitions toward sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen. In addition, there were no specific features to suggest an inherited mechanism for epilepsy.

voltage with generous beta and a glimpse of an 11 Hz alpha rhythm

and some central alpha and beta frequency activity.  There are


isolated bursts of slowing with lower voltage delta noted in the




background.  At the very end of the record, the patient seems to

be becoming more drowsy with a decrease in muscle and an increase


in slowing.




Heart rate 60 bpm.



IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging, but abnormal EEG due to:

1. Excess beta.


2. Intermittent isolated bursts of delta.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal features could be identified in

this record.  There were no epileptiform features seen.  Overall,

this EEG is more supportive of a global disturbance of cerebral

function.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a bedside record without hyperventilation and photic stimulation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there was a 10Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in beta.

In wakefulness, there were bursts of frontally predominant rhythmic high amplitude 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity.

No impairment of awareness was noted with the events.  The patient was able to answer questions even with very brief discharges, but again discharges are typically 1 to 1.5 seconds after going slow activity, lasting an another second at maximum duration.

The technologist notes 1 or 2 movements of the patient, but no definitive myoclonus was captured.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.  There was a technical limitation with the T6 electrode which persisted even after it was fixed by the technician.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 9.5 Hz in frequency and 20-40 microvolts in amplitude best seen in the occipital region which attenuates with eye opening.  In drowsiness there is diffuse rhythmic theta bursts in all the channels.

There is an occasional burst of focal slowing seen in the left frontocentral region.

Hyperventilation was performed which showed a diffuse slowing of the record and increase in amplitude.

Photic stimulation showed minimal driving at 13 Hz but no abnormalities.

Heart rate 60 beats per minute.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to occasional bursts of focal slowing on the left frontocentral and frontotemporal regions.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is suggestive of a possible underlying structural abnormality in the left frontocentral and frontotemporal regions.  No epileptiform discharges were identified.  A more prolonged EEG recording may be more helpful to identify spikes or sharp waves.

INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement with the addition of anterior temporal single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software in addition to nurse's notes were used to review the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm and frontocentral beta.  Overall, there are theta delta mixed frequencies intermingled with multiple multifocal spikes which I will describe in Abnormal Discharges.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Multifocal spikes seen at O1, O2, T6, Fp1, Fp2, T3, and P4.  However, the spikes are mainly seen at O1 and O2 and Fp1/Fp2.
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen almost continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  During the record, there are multiple seizures which in the EEG appear to begin suddenly and display rhythmic, sharply contoured theta intermixed with beta that at times appears to be maximal frontally and then centrally with an overlying rhythmic occipital sharp focus.  The maximal focus or origin of the seizure is unclear.  It is also atypical as it does not appear to evolve as it suddenly starts, remains in the EEG at almost this irregular but continuous frequency, and then appears to slowly dissipate.  During these discharges, the patient appears to move her head side to side and sometimes moves her arms in a wild fashion.  On 1 occasion, her mouth appeared to twitch in the video.  The duration of these episodes can be anywhere from 1 or 2 minutes to prolonged 38-minute seizure.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to multiple seizures with unclear origin and multifocal spikes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of multiple generalized seizures with unclear origin as well as multiple areas of irritability and structural dysfunction as well as diffuse dysfunction consistent with diagnosis of symptomatic generalized epilepsy.

However, due to technical difficulties only 5 hours could be reviewed.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  39-year-old woman with episode of bilateral arm stiffness and gaze deviated to the right.  Has 4-5 seizures in the past month, screaming, with a history of Lennox-Gastaut, mental retardation.  Follow-up EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan, famotidine, Lovenox, topiramate, Flagyl, Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement with the addition of anterior temporal single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software in addition to nurse's notes were used to review the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm and frontocentral beta.  Overall, there are theta delta mixed frequencies intermingled with multiple multifocal spikes which I will describe in Abnormal Discharges.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Multifocal spikes seen at O1, O2, T6, Fp1, Fp2, T3, and P4.  However, the spikes are mainly seen at O1 and O2 and Fp1/Fp2.
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen almost continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  During the record, there are multiple seizures which in the EEG appear to begin suddenly and display rhythmic, sharply contoured theta intermixed with beta that at times appears to be maximal frontally and then centrally with an overlying rhythmic occipital sharp focus.  The maximal focus or origin of the seizure is unclear.  It is also atypical as it does not appear to evolve as it suddenly starts, remains in the EEG at almost this irregular but continuous frequency, and then appears to slowly dissipate.  During these discharges, the patient appears to move her head side to side and sometimes moves her arms in a wild fashion.  On 1 occasion, her mouth appeared to twitch in the video.  The duration of these episodes can be anywhere from 1 or 2 minutes to prolonged 38-minute seizure.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to multiple seizures with unclear origin and multifocal spikes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of multiple generalized seizures with unclear origin as well as multiple areas of irritability and structural dysfunction as well as diffuse dysfunction consistent with diagnosis of symptomatic generalized epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection as well as seizure detection software was used to review the events.

Overall there are theta-delta mixed frequencies intermingled with multiple multifocal spikes, which I will describe in the abnormal discharges.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  At 11:22:17 a.m., there is a seizure onset at 9-10 Hz alpha activity, maximum in left occipital region (01) with spread to left posterior quadrant and right occipital region, after 20 seconds seizure activity continues as 4-5 Hz theta activity maximum in left posterior quadrant for 40 seconds.  This activity was followed by sharply contoured delta activity with bihemispheric distribution for 90 seconds.  It was followed by postictal attenuation noted in bihemispheric region.  Clinically, patient did not show shaking or jerking, but per video patient seemed less responsive with eyes closed.  Towards the end of this recording, there were left periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges noted in left posterior quadrant region lasting for several minutes with no evolution. There was almost continuous left posterior quadrant slowing almost continuous noted during this recording.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to;

CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to standard the 10-20  system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  During maximal wakefulness the posterior dominant rhythm consists of 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an alpha rhythm of 8 to 8.3 Hz.  Most typically when the patient is maximally awake, the EEG is well organized with 8 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta.  In hyperventilation and following hyperventilation there are rare bursts of slowing in the temporal regions as the patient becomes drowsy.  Vertex waves are noted in stage I sleep.  The patient transitions in and out of stage I sleep and there is a slight asymmetry with slight disruption of faster frequency activity noted just in the transition in and out of sleep on the right.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting and out of stage II sleep, and results in scan driving.
Heart rate 84 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Shifting slowing in drowsiness and in the transition to stage II sleep, out of the acceptable range of normal for an adult of this age.
Slight focality with disruption of faster frequency activity on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The slowing of the alpha rhythm is a nonspecific finding, but supports an organic cause for this patient's clinical complaints.  Slowing of the alpha rhythm is a nonspecific finding, but can be seen in dementia, as well as a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.  The subtle focal features described above may be correlated with imaging.

She has episodes of losing time between 5 minutes to 2 hours.
MEDICATIONS:  Hydralazine, metoprolol, Neurontin, lovastatin, insulin, oxycodone, and amitriptyline.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG monitoring was performed in the EMU using the standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  An automated seizure and spike detection system and a patient activated alarm system were used.  Records were reviewed daily for EEG abnormalities and clinical events.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Interictal EEG from 08/12/2013 to 08/15/2013:  In the most alert state, there is a posterior dominant rhythm with frequency of 8.5-10.5 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is presence of frontal central low amplitude beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  A stage I sleep was characterized by disappearance of alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of eye blink and muscle artifact, as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves.  Stage II sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  Slow-wave sleep and REM sleep were also captured.  Focal slow waves seen rarely at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolt.
Clinical events:  On 08/14/2013 at 05:37 a.m., there was a push button event as the patient experienced 1 episode of missing time, slurred speech, disorientation.  There were no EEG ictal changes associated with this event.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG monitoring study due to rare left focal slowing at F7/T3.  Patient had 1 event as described above during this recording while she was awake and reports 1 episode of missing time with disorientation.  This event was associated with no ictal change on EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Focal slowing could be due to structural or functional dysfunction of underlying brain in the subcortical white matter in the left hemisphere.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  Patient had 1 event of missing time and disorientation for a few minutes with no EEG correlations.  This is one of the typical event that patient experiences as a seizure activity.  The capturing of missing time and confusion without any associated ictal change on EEG may be suggestive of a simple partial seizure since simple partial seizures are not always captured on scalp EEG or it could be suggestive of a nonepileptic event.  This EEG monitoring does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy since all of the patient's habitual events have not been captured.  If seizure remain a clinical concern, a repeat video EEG monitoring may be helpful.

EVENTS:  The patient had 3 events during the admission.  The first one occurred at 7:00 p.m. after the doctor asked her to raise and lower her hands, and breathe heavily.  The patient started complaining of a headache, later ringing in the ears and became unresponsive with the eyes twitching and rolling backwards with forced eye closure, and some trembling.  The patient also had complaints of some right-sided numbness before the episode started.  The patient remained unresponsive to verbal motor commands until about 7:06:28 p.m.  She had a second event at 8:53:40 p.m. with a similar presentation of eyes rolling back and becoming unresponsive to verbal commands, and then trembling lasting until 8:58 p.m.  At the end she cried just as she did in the first event.  Then she had a third event occurring at 9:53:08 p.m. lasting until 9:58:47 p.m. again with eye fluttering,  trembling and following commands, and afterwards crying.  During all 3 events even though the last 1 there was some substantial electrode artifact and muscle artifact there was no clear EEG changes.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a somewhat unusual background.  There are sections of the record with some 5-6 Hz posteriorly predominant activity with a 9 Hz mu rhythm.  The posterior dominant activity is slow, notched, and somewhat regular, suggesting that there may be an underlying somewhat irregular alpha subharmonic.  Prominent lambda confounds this picture.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.  The somewhat notched posterior predominant pattern is seen when the patient is awake, as well as she starts to drift into drowsiness.
Hyperventilation seems to accentuate underlying, posteriorly predominant slowing.
Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response.
Heart rate:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This must be considered an abnormal EEG due to:  Somewhat slow irregular theta frequency activity in the posterior regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Harmonic since subharmonics are normal findings, but there is clearly irregular posteriorly predominant theta that cannot be considered a normal variant.  This EEG differs from a previous EEG on January 4, 2013 which was a normal routine study.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal swelling seen intermittently at C3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
EPISODES:  During this recording the patient had an episode where she suddenly became unresponsive and her face on the right appeared to look slightly drooped.  She would not follow commands but would response to painful stimuli and at 1 point would answer questions.  Mainly she remains with her eyes closed and her right face appeared slightly drooped.  However, if they stimulated her, her eyes would open and she remained with a right facial droop except when talking.  This episode lasted about 4 minutes after which the patient started responding and then she started shaking her head again in a back-and-forth high-frequency motion, again appeared to be unresponsive, lasted for 30 seconds, stopped, and started again, and she was responsive in between.

INTRODUCTION:  This is 1-hour digital video EEG performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG opens to posterior dominant rhythm at 10 Hz with mid temporal delta activity at times and 7 Hz theta activity in the background.  Of note, there is left temporal sharp waves during a sleep that is out of criteria for normal variant.  In a stage I and a stage II of a sleep, the temporal sharp waves are more prominent especially on the left side.  These sharp waves can potentially be epileptogenic.  There is also prominent hypersynchronous theta activity and thorough sharp waves in transition from stage I and stage II of sleep, which again are out of proportion for normal variant.  At times, there is hypnagogic hypersynchronous activity seen.
Heart rate was 78 b.p.m.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is mildly abnormal due to:
Rare left temporal sharp waves.
Subtle focal slowing on the left side.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG has multiple normal variants and due to mild left rare temporal slowing that is more pronounced during the sleep.  This could be also potentially epileptogenic.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Impedances were acceptable, although T1 and T2 electrodes slightly greater than 5 kohms.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a low voltage, 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  In the initial sections of the record there is frequent eye blink, but there is also a subtle area of sharply contoured slowing in the right mid temporal region at T2 and T4.  Hyperventilation is performed slightly after this finding is noted and produces an increase in amplitude, an increase in beta and does not clearly accentuate this finding which is noted again as the patient becomes drowsy with slow rolling eye movements.  This subtle lower voltage focal slowing in the right mid to posterior temporal region has almost a periodicity and when there is some overlying alpha frequency activity there is appearance of a low voltage sharp but without an after going slow wave.  It persisted into drowsiness with an increase in beta but deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
The patient was relatively drowsy during photic stimulation which did elicit a driving response.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to right mid to posterior temporal focal slowing at times sharply contoured with a frequency of approximately 4 Hz.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are very similar to the previous study 05/13/2013.  There is a slight periodicity of the focal slowing.  These findings contrast to previous EEGs in childhood which are reported to have demonstrated generalized spike and wave activity.  But these findings were similar on the previous study and therefore are not likely to have been associated with the car accident and concussion.

INTRODUCTION:  Routine 21-channel EEG was performed utilizing the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement along with hyperventilation and photic stimulation EKG and EOG monitoring.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The white cresting background reveals a large amount of 50-70 microvolt amplitude posterior alpha rhythm with a large amount of 18-30 Hz low voltage of her frontocentral regions.  Large amount of eye blink artifacts were seen throughout much of the waking record.  Moderate amount of muscle artifact was also seen.  With eye opening, there was attenuation of alpha activity.  Periods of drowsiness were seen with attenuation of posterior rhythmic activity and increased slow to medium amount due to symmetric irregular slowing.  Hyperventilation for 3 minutes produced mild increased low to medium amounts.  Bilateral delta and theta frequency slowing.  Photic stimulation was accompanied by symmetric occipital driving.

INTRODUCTION:  Routine 24-minute outpatient digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  Impedances were acceptable under 5 kilohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is abnormal.  At best, there is an 8 Hz alpha rhythm but there is excess background theta.  In addition, there are occasional bursts of background delta some of which are a bit more posteriorly predominant.  Hyperventilation was performed early in the record and accentuated this finding.  As the patient became drowsy after hyperventilation, there was some shifting arrhythmic slowing a bit more prominent in the posterior regions.  Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.

HEART RATE:  40 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Bursts of frontal slow delta.
3. Occasional shifting occipital slowing.
4. Bradycardia.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  To put this EEG in the proper context, it is important to know when this patient had his most recent seizures.  This may represent a postictal finding.  Comparison with previous EEGs is suggested.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode
placement with 1 channel EKG. Impedances were acceptable aside from the T1-T2 electrodes.
Electrode placement was perhaps suboptimal due to some or the features of the vertex waves.
DESCRIPTION OF THE As the tracing begins, the patient is asleep. Features of stage 1 and
stage 2 sleep are noted with vertex activity and spindles. Intermittent bursts of delta were noted. There
is prominent beta. There is a slight asymmetry noted with a bit of slowing noted on the left with a bit more
delta on the left relative to the right Eye movement and EKG artifacts as well were noted 10 the
background.

Hyperventilation was performed early in the record. Hyperventilation clearly accentuates focal slowing
from the left hemisphere, and in hyperventilation, discrete left temporal sharp waves emerge. As the
hyperventilation concludes, the patient drifts off back to sleep with generous beta and again focal slowing
noted from the left. In more prolonged stage II sleep, some of the vertex waves and spindles are slightly
asymmetric. Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting off to sleep. II does not
significantly activate the record, but the focal sharp waves and focal slowing persist In sleep, there are
some lower voltage, discreet bilateral spikes noted with a bit of a field to the left.
At the close of the record, the patient is transitioning back into stage II sleep, but limited wakefulness was
identified with a symmetric brief posterior dominant rhythm.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal stowing from the left temporal region.
2. Discrete fell temporal spikes.
3. A number of discrete, bifrontal spikes.
4. Hypersomnolence.

Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV. 18-25Hz activity is present. maximal over bilateral frontal regions. No normal sleep architecture is present.

No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.


Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges

Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 26-minute awake-only EEG. No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically indicated. repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a technically acceptable EEG, although T1-T2 electrodes had impedances greater than 5 kilo-ohms.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with abundant vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and posts noted in stage II sleep.
Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was falling off to sleep and did not significantly activate the record.
Of note, although most of the vertex waves and K complexes are symmetric, there are rare waveforms which have a slight asymmetry and are slightly maximum in terms of the field on the right, although the phase reversal is at CZ.
IMPRESSION:  This is a subtly abnormal EEG due to:
Slightly asymmetric vertex waves and K complexes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive sharp waves or spikes were noted. This is not a clear example of dyshormia.  If additional information is needed to characterize his epilepsy, a more prolonged study may be obtained.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine 20 minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically acceptable record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is acceptably organized, but there are some sections in maximal wakefulness when it is not and there is excess theta.  There is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which was sometimes disrupted on the left.  Intermittent rhythmic left temporal theta was noted with TIRDA.  This seems to be augmented high hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.
Photic stimulation did elicit a driving response despite the focal features described above.  Hyperventilation seems to accentuate the left temporal slowing.  Brief stage I and stage II sleep include vertex waves and spindles.

Description:
There is no clear PDR or AP gradient while the patient is awake. The awake background consists of a mixture of a low amplitude beta>theta activity with theta activity most pronounced over the left frontotemporal region. As the recording progresses, the background becomes more attenuated- this corresponds to initiation  of phenobarbital. Additional underriding fast activity is captured over the left anterior quadrant. Diffuse excess beta activity is seen. Continuous high amplitude rhythmic and semi­ rhythmic (PLEDs and quasi-PLEDs) up to 1 Hz sharp waves with aftergoing slow waves emanate from
the left anterior quadrant, most prominent over the F3 lead. Starting at -8:27 AM, intermittent left anterior quadrant seizures appear. They last - 25-60 seconds and have no clinical correlate. They occur at variable frequency throughout the recording, up to multiple times per hour (between 4-5 PM), ie, frank focal status epilepticus. Last clear seizure is captured at -2:07 AM. Electrographically, seizures start with rhythmic left anterior delta- theta activity that rapidly increases in amplitude and rhythmicity, decreases in frequency and spreads throughout the left hemisphere. Periods of brief background discontinuity and sleep-spindle-like waveforms (more visible over the left) are seen during sleep.

INTRODUCTION:  A 1-hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was quite somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the overall EEG is low voltage with generous beta.  Scant alpha rhythm was identified.  In this low voltage record, in hyperventilation and drowsiness, there is a subtle, low voltage infrequent somewhat irregular, left temporal slowing.  In addition, there are rare bursts of focal slowing from the right temporal region noted following hyperventilation.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta, followed by vertex waves and K complexes, as well as spindles.
Notable findings in this record include a brief burst of slower, rhythmic 3 hertz delta activity from the left temporal region.  This is followed by a single, low voltage, left temporal sharp waves.  These findings are best visualized in an average reference.

This is a NORMAL 27 minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Patient rapidly transitions into sleep. Bursts of diffuse theta activity likely represent intrusions of sleep architecture into drowsiness. This could be explained by an excessively drowsy patient. An episode of left pinky twitching is captured (it lasts ~ 2 min 30 sec). There is no abnormal activity captured on a scalp EEG. However, only ~ 25% of simple partial seizures are captured on a scalp EEG.

INTRODUCTION:  A 30-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient had limited communication skills and a translator was used during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is awake with a 12 hertz alpha rhythm generous, low voltage, frontal central beta.
In wakefulness and early drowsiness, brief bursts of high amplitude, generalized spike and wave activity were noted.  Some of these seem to begin with a burst of fast activity in the occipital regions with a 3-5 Hz spike and wave complex.  The complexes vary in the frequency, many of them are 3 hertz with a polyspike, but the later spikes in the complex are always consistently slower.  Generally, these are frontally predominant spike and wave complexes and those that occur out of drowsiness do not have this beta buzz prior to the spikes.  The patient is noted to have a subtle head bob and sometimes some movement of her legs during the bursts.  She seems to have clinical symptoms with bursts that are 2 seconds in duration.  The bursts are present in wakefulness and early drowsiness.  Hyperventilation may have increase the duration of the spike and wave and polyspike and wave complexes.  In addition, during hyperventilation, there may be a little bit more fast activity.  The patient was otherwise able to answer questions, before and after the discharges.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response.  Spike and wave activity was noted with a 21 hertz discharge, but was not prolonged relative to other sections of the record.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to generalized spike and wave activity with bursts of 3-5 Hz frontally predominant spike and wave activity.

attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges
on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excessive beta activity could
be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.

The patient treated briefly with Keppra, which was resumed after the patient had a recurrent seizure.  Episode in 2015 with seizure characterized by impairment of awareness.  Chronic left headache, left facial twitching.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Klonopin.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 8.5-9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  A clear breach rhythm was noted from the left with higher amplitude alpha on the left in comparison to the right.  There is prominent muscle artifact noted in the left frontal temporal electrodes with fast activity of approximately 35 hertz.  As the patient becomes drowsy, focal slowing is identified in the left mid temporal region.  The patient does not sustain deeper stages of sleep.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving response.  Hyperventilation was deferred.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to
intermittent focal slowing noted in drowsiness from the left temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The breach rhythm identified above is an anticipated finding following craniotomy and is congruent with the previous left cranial surgery.  There is prominent 35 hertz fast activity noted in the left temporalis/ scalp over congruent with the patient's clinical symptoms and he has complaint of an ongoing muscle spasm in that area.  (Muscle artifact)
This is the 3rd EEG for this individual.  It demonstrates significant improvement in comparison to the immediate postoperative study in June 2014.
No epileptiform features were noted in the last two EEGS.

INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a followup EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements.
Notable in this record, hyperventilation seems to elicit a somewhat asymmetric hyperventilation response with drop out of faster frequency activity on the left compared to the right and a bit of slowing on the left, although there is some movement artifact.  In addition, in drowsiness, the alpha rhythm drops out on the left a little earlier than the right.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
Heart rate irregular, 60-80 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing noted on the left, seen in hyperventilation and in the transition to drowsiness.

DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  During the early hours of the record, the background EEG is diffusely slow.  There are intermittent rhythmic bursts of theta noted from the left temporal region, but these do not have clear build up and are not associated with clear change in the patient's level of consciousness.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, the EEG is markedly slow and featureless.
In this section of the record, no clinical seizures were recorded.  Practice push buttons were noted.  The patient had an episode of vocalization without clear clinical correlate.
Heart rate:  90 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Day #1, April 7th to 8th:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
A markedly slow pattern.
Some bursts of rhythmic slowing noted in the initial sections of the record without clinical change.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is postictal, agitated, and had difficulty cooperating.  Impedances were all under 5 kilohms because of this.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG includes generous muscle and generous beta.  There is a glimpse of a 12 Hz alpha rhythm, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is also some lower voltage rhythmic frontal delta noted in wakefulness.  At the very final few minutes of the EEG, the patient starts to drift off to sleep with a lower voltage beta pattern.  In this technically challenging EEG, there is a slight beta asymmetry with a bit more beta noted on the left, relative to the right.
Heart rate 120 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is technically challenging, but abnormal EEG due to:
Excess beta.
Likely some frontal delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Given the limitations of this EEG, focal features may be overlooked and the beta asymmetry is of unclear significance.  To more completely characterize this patient's EEG, a followup study when he is more cooperative is suggested.

MEDICATIONS:  Phenytoin.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a very tense patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there was a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by attenuation of alpha rhythm with slow rolling eye movements.  In drowsiness, the rhythmic theta was slightly asymmetric, slightly more prominent on the right.  Unfortunately, sleep was not sustained.
Hyperventilation produced a small amount of slowing in the frontal regions without definitive asymmetry.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is at the limits of normal in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Limited sleep was identified, but there is a suggestion of some focal slowing on the right in the transition to sleep. This is the second EEG without epileptiform activity.  Consideration for a more prolonged study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.

INTRODUCTION:  A 40-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically acceptable EEG capturing wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Drowsiness includes attenuation of the alpha rhythm with POSTS.  In stage 2 sleep, vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS were noted.
Hyperventilation produces muscle artifact.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Of note in this record, there is a single, well-defined right temporal sharp wave noted just following the vertex wave and a single, more subtle discharge also noted in stage 2 sleep.  The primary discharge noted seems to occur after an arousal with eye movement in stage 2 sleep.

INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.  This is a primarily drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background from the left hemisphere is medium amplitude with a mixture of theta and delta.  When the patient arouses, there is a glimpse of an alpha rhythm.  Continuous focal delta was noted from the right hemisphere, maximum in the right temporal region.  Through much of the record, the patient is somewhat drowsy, but when maximally awake, the pattern on the left is within normal limits.
Heart rate:  96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to continuous right temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This tracing differs from a previous study 01/28/2015.  It now demonstrates focal features in the right hemisphere, which may be correlated with imaging.

Description:
Patient is sedated as the recording opens.  The background is symmetrical and consists of a mixture
of polymorphic frequencies (delta, theta, alpha and beta).  Occasionally the background becomes
discontinuous or frankly burst-suppressed.  These changes are related to adjustments in anesthesia.
Left internal carotid artery is clamped at 6:55 pm and left common carotid artery is clamped ~ 25-
30 seconds later.  Within ~ 15-20 seconds of clamping the left common carotid artery, diffuse
change is seen.  It is more pronounced over the left.  This change is characterized by voltage
attenuation as well as abrupt disappearance of fast frequencies.  The attending surgeon is notified
of these changes immediately and shunt placement takes place.  Simultaneously, there is increase
in the dose of  sevoflurane and prominent diffuse delta activity appears as a result.  The primary
team is informed of these changes.  EEG returns to the pre-clamp baseline b ~ 7:06 PM.  Left
carotid artery is re-clamped at ~ 8:48 PM and EEG changes within ~ 5 seconds.  This change is
characterized by diffuse (left>right) voltage attenuation and dominance of delta activity.  EEG
change persists until ~ 8;55 PM when left internal and common carotid arteries are unclamped.
EEG gradually returns to the pre-clamp baseline.
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL ~4 hour continuous intraoperative EEG due to global (left>right) changes
that were seen after clamp was applied to the left common and internal carotid arteries. However,
by the end of the recording, EEG appeared symmetrical and at pre-clamp baseline.  Total time of
the direct EEG monitoring by the EEG attending: ~ 2 hours.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This was a technically challenging bedside record in an uncomfortable individual with a hair weave.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is diffusely slow with primarily a theta frequency pattern and a glimpse of a 6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Shifting slowing was noted.  Bursts of paroxysmal rhythmic slowing were noted as the patient becomes drowsy.
There is a brief section where the patient appears to transition briefly to stage 2 sleep with vertex waves and then an arousal.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing.
FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are nonspecific, but support a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  Although this is a sharply contoured record, there are no definitive epileptiform discharges.  These findings should be incorporated into this patient's current clinical scenario.

Patient subsequently received tramadol for a fracture and had a tonic-clonic seizure.  The patient was started on carbamazepine and since then, complains of feeling spacey.
INTRODUCTION:  One-hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient has received levetiracetam 1000 mg during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the background EEG is diffusely slow with an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm, but with excess beta and bursts of theta.  Bursts of frontally predominant spike and wave activity are noted.  In addition, isolated right or left frontal spike and wave discharges are noted.  Some of these demonstrate a prominence in the right hemisphere.  Hyperventilation was performed early in the record and clearly accentuates frontally predominant spike and wave activity.  The spike and wave activity ranges from 3 to 5 hertz in frequency.   Discharges are not sustained with most spike and wave complexes either isolated or occurring in bursts, less than 1.5 seconds duration.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting off to sleep.  This spike and wave discharges did not seem to be augmented by the photic stimulation, but as the patient transitions to sleep, there was a higher amplitude, frontally predominant slowing with a bit more slow spike and wave activity.  Levetiracetam was given at approximately 12 p.m. and the EEG was recorded until 12:41.  Following the levetiracetam, by 12:30, there did appear to be a decrease in the spike and wave activity.  The paroxysmal slowing was a little less remarkable and while the EEG remained abnormal with excess theta, the overall pattern was improving.  The alpha rhythm was at 8.3 hertz at conclusion.
Heart rate, slightly irregular at 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Initially markedly abnormal background with excess slowing and disorganized pattern, improving towards the close of the record.
Frontally predominant spike and slow wave activity.
Focal spike and slow wave activity with a predominance further on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG may represent a focal or a secondary generalized mechanism for epilepsy.  There was a small degree of irregularity in the heart rate noted in the final pages of the EEG, which may be evaluated by different mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 8 Hz alpha rhythm.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
Heart rate: 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG might mildly abnormal due to:
Mild slowing of the alpha rhythm.

symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  Two typical events are
captured early in the recording (~11:47 AM and 12:07 PM).  They are characterized by decreased
