Patient seizure-free for five years.  The patient is now experiencing staring spells at work.  Previous history of tonic-clonic seizures.

MEDICATIONS: Norvasc.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 30 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  Hyperventilation does not activate the record.  The major abnormalities occur around the time of photic stimulation.  The tech starts to awaken the patient for photic.  A brief burst lasting just under one second is seen with high amplitude, sharply contoured activity without a really well-defined spike and slow wave complex, but with notched frontal activity.  Reviewing the burst with different montages, it seems to phase reverse slightly to the left.

1 seizure occurred in the EEG lab at 13:51.  This follows photic stimulation, but does not occur during photic stimulation.  The patient is resting quietly with her eyes closed.  As the seizure begins at 13:51:57, no clinical signs or symptoms are noted.  The technologist notes the change in behavior.  The patientÕs eyes open at 13:52:10.  The technologist asks the patient questions at 13:52:16.  The patient opens her eyes and swallows.  When asked where she is she replies that she is in the neurologistÕs office.  She remains somewhat confused in the minutes that follow.  The tech calls the patient at 13:52:39.   At 13:52:46, she sits, staring blankly, and then she starts to rub her eyes in her head.  The tech asks if she is okay.  At this point, when the tech is asking the patient questions, the seizure has ended and the patient is confused.

EEG characteristics of this seizure include the appearance of rhythmic theta frequency activity, which is more remarkable in the posterior regions.  This seizure seems to start with some low voltage fast activity and then some rhythmic theta, more remarkable in the posterior regions and perhaps maximum in the right posterior region.  Reviewing this seizure with a circle montage, seems to confirm a phase reversal in the right occipitotemporal region but also involving the right central region, nearly isoelectric Cz to C4.  The activity shows frequency evolution and seems to occur in two phases with secondary build-up at 13:52:19 with fast activity and more of a generalized appearance.  The activity ends at 13:52:51 as the patient starts to rub her head with postictal slowing.

HR:  96 BPM.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Complex partial seizure, which was difficult to localize and which may have had some generalized features at the start, but with some evidence of focality in the same seizure.
2. An unusual paroxysmal burst frontal in nature.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of an underlying seizure disorder.  There may be more than one contributing factor for this patientÕs seizures.  This EEG did not provide adequate localization for the seizures that this individual experienced.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Previous EEGs are not available for comparison.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in background slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  Of note, there is a single four second burst in photic stimulation where the patient seems to have had eye flutter, but looking at the eyes there is no discernable eye movement, and the activity is in the frontal regions with a somewhat different field of spread in the eye monitor in comparison to the patient’s other eye movements.  This burst is highly suspicious for frontally predominant notched delta as might be seen in generalized spike and slow wave activity.
HR:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This EEG is abnormal due to:
1.	A single, suspicious, approximately 2 to 3 second burst of notched frontal delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  The activity described above can be seen in a primary or secondary generalized process.  Rather than repeating additional studies, correlation with previous studies may be the most effective way to place these findings in their appropriate clinical context.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. This patient’s previous EEGs were available for comparison.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is a scant amount of background theta, compatible with age.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing a small amount of slowing. There is a single burst of notched slowing in the occipital regions, right greater than left, seen at the end of hyperventilation.  As the patient becomes drowsy, additional, sharply contoured irregular slowing is seen.  The burst identified is generalized, but there may be an underlying right temporal sharp wave associated with that burst.  Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving.
HR:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Very subtly abnormal EEG due to:
Two somewhat unusual bursts seen in the background with some localization to the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to this patient’s two previous EEGs, there is much less in the way of epileptiform activity, and the overall background is more consistently normal.  The epileptiform activity in this record was not well defined - really only suspicious underlying sharply contoured activity with the paroxysmal bursts.  These findings suggest an improvement compared to the first study.

MEDICATIONS: Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz, 30 to 50 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by prominent rhythmic diffuse theta activity particularly in the occipital regions.  Hyperventilation is performed out of drowsiness and seems to accentuate this activity as well.  There are rare bursts of higher amplitude more sharply contoured frontal theta at the close of hyperventilation and there is a single, discrete left anterior temporal sharp wave in the transition from hyperventilation to sleep.  As the patient reaches stage I sleep, there are slow rolling eye movements with attenuation of the alpha rhythm, vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.
Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is relatively asleep with features of stage II sleep identified during photic stimulation.  While there is a low voltage, symmetric brief driving response following photic stimulation as the patient drifts off to sleep, there are two bursts of symmetric, low voltage TFA.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG to due to:
Brief bursts of generalized paroxysmal fast activity identified following photic stimulation in a state of relative drowsiness.
A single left anterior temporal sharp wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is the third EEG for this patient.  The GPFA is similar to abnormalities identified on the October 5, 2000 EEG.  The 1994 EEG was normal, and the 2002 EEG identified some left 5 Hz activity from the occipital scalp region.  The major relevant difference between the two EEGs is the presence of a discrete, left frontal sharp wave.  This has been reported in the literature as part of the maturational process of a primary generalized epilepsy, but it could also be seen in the setting of a partial or focal epilepsy as well.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1  channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is 8Hz posterior dominant rhythm.
In hyperventilation and in drowsiness,  however, there is more rhythmic 5Hz background theta with almost a rhythmic 5Hz posterior dominant rhythm.
There are intermittent bursts of frontally predominant generalized spike and wave and polyspike and wave activity. These occur in hyperventilation and are of 3-5 seconds duration. They are seen post hyperventilation in bursts lasting approximately 3 seconds in duration. The last burst is seen at 120 seconds post hyperventilation as the patient transitions into sleep.  Additional bursts are seen in the transition to stage I sleep.  They do not clearly produce an arousal response, although the first burst is seen in the first transition to sleep.  Other features of stage II  sleep include spindles and posts.
Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.   On 1 occasion the spike and wave activity also seems to be associated with the photic stimulation.
Heart rate: 70 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Bursts of 3-5Hz frontally predominant spike and wave activity and polyspike and wave activity.
2.	Spike and wave activity seen in hyperventilation and 1 time photic stimulation.
3.	Rhythmic theta activity, greater than one might expect in wakefulness and early drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The primary epileptiform abnormality in this record is generalized spike and wave activity as was previously identified.  There are a number of other normal variants or mild abnormalities, including the prominent 5 Hz activity identified. There is also some psychomotor variant, which in this case is likely a normal variant.

DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background includes a 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive.  There is generous background beta.  Notable in this record is an occipitally predominant 5 hertz rhythmic discharge.  It is occipitally predominant and has at times almost a spike and wave complex.  It is typically more prominent in the right occipital region than the left, although on occasion, does appear to be a bit more prominent on the left.
The discharge is prominent at the midline with a slight predominance to the left.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation clearly accentuate this discharge.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.
Heart rate:  60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The activity described above is probably an epileptiform variant and may be related to this patient's previous generalized spike and wave discharge.  The activity is more prominent at the midline and just to the right of the midline, although it is sometimes seen on the left. No clinical events were recorded.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with symmetric, reactive 10 Hz, 30 to 50 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. In both hyperventilation and in drowsiness, there is an increase in shifting, right or left temporal theta, as well as some sharply contoured theta frequency activity which reaches higher amplitudes up to 70 V from the right mid-to-anterior temporal region.   Stage II sleep is characterized by symmetric vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.
Photic stimulation elicits symmetric driving, as well as LAMBDA waves.
HR:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1.	The appearance of shifting, right greater than left temporal theta in drowsiness and hyperventilation with higher amplitude, more sharply contoured theta activity from the right identified on one occasion from the temporal regions and on one occasion from the parietal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The features described above are non-specific.  They support a process involving the temporal regions and the right hemisphere more strongly than the left.  While there are no definite epileptiform discharges, the sharply contoured higher amplitude theta from the right hemisphere is suggestive of such a process.  Correlation with imaging and previous EEGs may be of use.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The patient experiences a single episode of left leg shaking.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with symmetric, reactive 10 Hz, 25 V posterior dominant rhythm and occasional posterior slow waves of youth.  In the transition to drowsiness, on rare occasions, there is subtle, rhythmic theta activity identified from the left anterior temporal and frontal region.  On one occasion, this activity is also identified in hyperventilation.  Features of stage I sleep include high amplitude vertex waves.
Hyperventilation elicits a rare burst of slowing described above as well as bursts of rhythmic, high amplitude 3 Hz activity which is well formed, but without definite spike or slow wave activity underlying it.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This was a fasting record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with symmetric, reactive 10 Hz alpha rhythm reaching amplitudes up to 70  V with posterior slow waves of youth. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and elicits initially subtle, left temporal sharply contoured theta, which is somewhat irregular.  There appears to be a sharp wave varied in this frontotemporal theta.  The sharp wave can be identified on three different occasions.  Review of this activity with reformatting suggests a maximum at F7 but on other occasions in the left frontal region.  As hyperventilation continues, there are bursts of synchronous, high amplitude rhythmic frontally predominant delta.  Features of stage II sleep include high amplitude vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  Photic stimulation elicits symmetric driving.
HR:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Left anterior temporal focal slowing with a suspicious underlying sharp wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This second record again identifies left anterior temporal focal slowing.  The suspicious sharp wave merits additional evaluation to determine whether or not this patient is having behaviors which are seizures in addition to the behaviors which appear to have been confirmed not to be epileptiform.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 12 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with an increase in faster frequency activity and then attenuation of the alpha with background theta.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.  Photic stimulation is remarkable for LAMBDA activity, but also some driving at faster flash frequencies.  Hyperventilation produces a generous burst of high amplitude, frontally predominant 3 to 5 Hz activity.  The patient reports feeling tingling in the mouth and hands during HV.  The data is re-reviewed with appropriate sensitivities and even with fewer channels per page to make sure that there is no underlying spike and wave activity, and none can be determined

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG for an adult of this age in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The relatively fast alpha rhythm is not pathological.  There is a very vigorous, high amplitude response to hyperventilation, but there is no definite spike and wave activity.  In this individual with seizures a year ago, a repeat study with hyperventilation may be of value.  Alternatively, comparison with childhood EEGs may provide the same information.

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and an excess
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only routine EEG, remarkable only for excess of beta frequencies.  There are
no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.





CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.



If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.

Excess beta activity may be seen in the setting of a medication effect (i.e., benzodiazepines,
barbiturates).

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were attempted.  The patient spoke no English and had no caregiver to help translate. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial portions of the record are well-organized with a 9.25 Hz, 40 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In the initial portions of the record, the patient is a bit drowsy and hyperventilation is attempted.  There are bursts seen in this portion of the record in the temporal regions.  There are irregular bursts, which appear in the left or right temporal regions, sometimes a bit more on one side than the other or starting on the left and going to right or vice versa.  With the use of the T1-T2 electrodes, the activity appears to be maximum at T1 and there is an underlying sharp wave at T1-T3.  This becomes more prominent in the later HV recording. In these bursts, there are also T2 sharp waves and a sharply contoured background.  Following hyperventilation, as the patient becomes drowsy, there are additional sharp waves again seen at T1.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in the irregular temporal theta and the occasional sharp waves.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Irregular temporal slowing with an unusual field of spread often involving both temporal regions but asynchronous.
Left greater than right temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy.  If further characterization of this patient’s epilepsy is needed, an additional recording capturing sleep or one of her seizures would be helpful.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10.4 Hz, 50 to 60 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm followed by attenuation of the alpha with a handful of vertex waves.  In the transition to sleep, there are some bursts of mixed rhythmic theta and delta, which are somewhat irregular but not epileptiform in nature.  An identical 3-second burst is seen at the close of hyperventilation.
At the close of the record, wicket activity is identified in the transition to and from sleep, which is somewhat asymmetric, a little bit more prominent on the left than the right.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This bedside portable EEG is relatively low voltage.  The patient is lethargic and there is a fair amount of muscle artifact.  There is a suggestion of a posterior dominant rhythm of 7.5 Hz, 15 V in a background that is low voltage with beta and small quantities of low voltage theta.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 30 to 50 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. In wakefulness, on rare occasions, there is a small amount of discrete beta activity from the right temporal region.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and again produces a small amount of discrete, rhythmic theta activity.  Some of this is identified in the posterior regions on the right and measures at 6 Hz.    As hyperventilation continues, there are one or two bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta activity from the temporal regions.  Following hyperventilation, there is some EKG artifact in the right temporal region.  Despite this, there is subtle, discrete right temporal slowing and a handful of tiny, discrete right temporal sharp waves, which can be differentiated from the patient’s EKG and are identified in quiet wakefulness.
Photic stimulation elicits brief driving.  At the close of the record, just following hyperventilation, intermittent bursts of background slowing with vertex waves and K complexes are identified followed by arousals, supportive of stage II sleep.

There is a 10 Hz, 30 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Wicket activity can be seen in the right temporal area.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in the background amplitude as well as a small amount of slowing.  In drowsiness discrete T4 sharp activity, occasionally with slow activity, was seen.  Sleep is characterized by slow rolling eye movements, followed by theta.  In stage II sleep: spindles, and K complexes.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and a sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm.  Hyperventilation is performed early in the record producing a small amount of background slowing as well as slowing of the alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and then slow rolling eye movements in more of a beta pattern.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR:    66 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness drowsiness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's previous EEGs were not available for comparison.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy, but this patient has been seizure free for a decade.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage I sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric and fairly well organized.  There is an 8.5 Hz, 75 to 100 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.   During hyperventilation, occasional bursts of slow theta and delta activity are seen in the left temporal or right temporal area. This burst pattern is also seen in drowsiness.  Drowsiness is characterized by vertex waves. Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
Photic stimulation elicits driving.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Irregular bursts of slow theta and delta activity in the left or right temporal area.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The above finding is a non-specific pattern and may be linked to the underlying pathologic process secondary to the frontal lobe contusion.  However, no epileptiform features were identified in this record.  If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or sleep deprivation prior to the EEG may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is described as poorly cooperative.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow with a 7 to 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and excess background theta, as well as generous, low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In this background with theta, there is left temporal wicket activity with some wicket identified on the right. In the transition to drowsiness, there are occasional bursts of frontally predominant delta.  Features noted as the patient becomes drowsy include an increase in background beta.  Occasional K complexes are seen in stage II sleep, again followed by arousals.
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort producing a small degree of slowing in the background.  Photic stimulation does not significantly activate this record.
HR:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This patient’s medications, hepatic problems, or retroviral infection may all produce the background slowing described above as may a postictal state.  While the wicket is a sharply contoured normal variant, no definite epileptiform features were seen, and a more prolonged recording in stage II sleep may be helpful to identify epileptiform activity.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  The patient starts hyperventilation early on in the record without the development of epileptiform activity.  At 11:48:34, he begins to have shaking movements, shaking the head from side to side and arms going up and down.  There are then some rotatory components or circular movements of the head.  The activity waxes and wanes.  The physician comes in to test the patient at 11:55:30.  The patient’s behavior waxes and wanes.  He is examined by a physician and nurse, and is clearly interactive during the spell.  Ativan is given at 16:14 and by 16:17, he is a bit more responsive and interactive.  When asked where he is, he responds that he is at [hospital] Hospital.  The EEG demonstrates a relatively normal pattern by the end with some generous beta.

TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG HV, and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive low amplitude  10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR),
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:





Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.




Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the Neuro ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is continuous and symmetric with generalized slowing.  There is a 7 to 8 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm, which is well attenuated with eyes opened.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Soon after the EEG commences, the patient began to shake her left arm and then both arms and hands on her abdomen.  The shaking was in a different direction at different rhythms.  The patient could open and close her eyes and follow commands during this episode.  Alternatively, when her left-hand shaking stopped, she began to open and close her legs with shaking, left side worse then the right.  With the prolonged episode, muscle movement artifact can be seen, but no significant EEG changes or correlates were found.  On the video camera, several doctors were called to see the patient.  The patient can open and close her eyes, follow commands, and lift her arms and legs up.  Interestingly, the patientÕs episodes spontaneously subsided if no one paid attention to her and she responded to a placebo of saline injection.  Throughout the EEG, there were no epileptiform discharges, but occasionally sharply contoured delta activity in the left central area is seen.

HR:  116 BPM.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Diffusely slow background.
2. Occasional sharply contoured delta in the left central area.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The diffusely slow background, as well as occasional sharply contoured delta activity in the left central area may be suggestive of an underlying pathological process in this patient, which is commonly seen in patients with hypertension and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.  This finding can also be seen in patients with subdural hematoma.  During the tracing, the patient had prolonged episodes of arm or leg shaking without EEG change, as well as being responsive to commands.  This is suggestive of non-epileptic seizures.  These findings were communicated with the primary neurosurgery team.  If epilepsy is a clinical concern or clinically indicated, when the patient is more stable and cooperative, a repeat EEG in the lab with full activation including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, as well as capturing deeper stages of sleep may be helpful.

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:





A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, no
sleep spindles and K-complexes seen. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) causes driving
response.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

Prior EEGs have demonstrated posterior quadrant sharp waves which were not seen today. No focal
slowing was seen today.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In wakefulness, there is frequent eye blink, but in the transition from wakefulness to drowsiness, there is also notched, sharply contoured, frontally predominant 5 to 7 Hz activity in the frontal regions, as well as a signal left mid-to-anterior temporal sharp wave.  There were a total of four left anterior temporal sharp waves.  Features of sleep include an increase in beta activity as well as occasional vertex waves and spindles.  There are multiple brief arousals from sleep.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and appears to accentuate some of the rhythmic frontal 5 to 7 Hz activity.  In sleep, there is a second, left temporal sharp wave.
Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Some sharply contoured, notched 5 to 7 Hz activity seen in the frontal regions, sometimes with isolated discharges and sometimes seen with brief bursts seen in wakefulness and in sleep.

Hyperventilation produced a vigorous hyperventilation response with an increase in rhythmic theta as well as an increase in beta.  There is some subtle, asymmetric bursts noted in hyperventilation with higher amplitude rhythmic theta noted on the left.  There is one, suspicious underlying sharp waves noted at the close of hyperventilation in the right centrotemporal region.
Heart rate 56 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a subtly abnormal EEG due to:
A very subtle asymmetry, identified using a frequency analysis with an increase in 7 Hz activity noted intermittently in the right hemisphere with disruption of the alpha rhythm.
An asynchronous hyperventilation response with higher amplitude rhythmic theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Only a single sharp wave was seen there for this must not be considered definitively epileptogenic.  This is the 7th EEG for this individual.  Previous EEGs have identified right mid temporal sharp waves, which were not identified at this time.  This patient's 2004-2008 EEGs were not available for comparison.  No prominent epileptiform or focal features were noted, and no new findings were noted in this record.

SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, hyperventilation, and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


Wakefulness is characterized by symmetric and reactive 9-10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR)
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Low amplitude symmetric 18-30 Hz activity was
seen anteriorly, with superimposed muscle and frontal eye blink artifact



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 64 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9 Hz, 30 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Photic stimulation is performed early on in the record.  A brief driving response is seen, but as the patient relaxes a little bit further, subtle left temporal slowing is seen.  Hyperventilation is performed subsequently and the subtle focal features can be identified.  A seizure occurred following hyperventilation and post-hyperventilation.  Post-hyperventilation, the focal slowing gradually increases 20 seconds after the onset of hyperventilation.  The seizure onset is at 14:08:37 with no clinical signs, but high amplitude spike and slow wave activity with rhythmic delta and then high amplitude delta and sharply contoured delta with a clear phase reversal at T1.  The patient starts to arouse at 14:08:57, opening his eyes and then stiffening.  He is slightly tremulous and demonstrates chewing movements.  The activity makes the transition to repetitive alpha frequency activity and then 5 Hz frequency activity by 14:09:17.  The activity begins to slow and ends at 14:09:38 for an approximate one-minute seizure duration.  The background EEG demonstrates postictal slowing in the minutes that follow, which gradually resolves.  The patient is unable to speak during the seizure and in the postictal period he nods his head from side to side.  He has a relatively lengthy postictal period including almost all the way to the end of the record.  Over time, he becomes increasingly able to speak, although initially he answers all questions with “uhm-uhm” noise.  Over time, he can answer questions, but has difficulty performing simple tasks.

As the tracing continues, spike and sharp waves,  with and without slow activity, is seen at the F7 and T1 regions.   These  focal discharges  increased with hyperventilation  and also were seen in post-hyperventilation. They were occasionally  seen in photic stimulation.   Sleep  is evidenced by slow  rolling eye movements,  a mixed frequency of brain activity, vertex waves, spindles, and K complexes.   Photic stimulation elicits driving.
HR:  72BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Spike and sharp with slow wave activity in the left anterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal findings in this abnormal EEG are suggestive of an underlying pathological  process and provide a localization-related  mechanism  for epilepsy in this patient.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Central MU rhythm is identified, but testing is not performed to confirm this.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing a small amount of theta.   This is followed by sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  In the transition to sleep, there is some very subtle asymmetries in the anteriotemporal region on the left.  In stage II sleep, there are rare, left temporal subtle sharp waves.  In addition, in one section of the stage II sleep record, there is somewhat more sustained mixed theta and delta lasting approximately seven seconds.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKGand photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:




A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.

TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.	The waking background is low voltage with frequent eye flutter
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
There are normal sleep transients, with synchronous sleep
spindles and rare K-complexes present during Stage II sleep. Slow wave sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces mild diffuse symmetric background increase in amplitude as well as symmetric frontal theta/delta.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. The patient’s previous EEGs were not available at this time.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is intermittent rhythmic theta from the left hemisphere.  Although there is a breach rhythm, and there is some muscle artifact, there appears to be an underlying spike and slow wave complex identified from the left mid-temporal region, accentuated by hyperventilation.  Following hyperventilation, the patient becomes drowsy and in drowsiness there are vertex waves and POSTS.  The amplitude is somewhat higher from the left than the right, accentuating the POSTS on the left.  As the patient reaches sleep, in this sharply contoured background, there is both accentuation of beta on the left but there are a handful of sharp waves that also come out of this background.  Snore artifact is also identified in stage II sleep.
Photic stimulation elicits a driving response, which is markedly accentuated on the left.
HR:  54 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Left temporal theta accentuated by drowsiness and hyperventilation.
Left temporal sharp waves in hyperventilation and in stage II sleep.  The morphology is compatible with a breach rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The prominent breach rhythm accentuates the beta activity in stage II sleep and produces an increase in the amplitude of the background in photic stimulation, but is simply a manifestation of the previous craniotomy.  The focal slowing and sharp waves supports a temporal lobe disturbance and a localization-related mechanism for seizures.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient is poorly responsive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow, a theta pattern. With stimulation, there is an increase in faster frequency activity. There is an area of sharply contoured slowing in the right posterior temporal region. Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting response, but when stimulation ends, the patient drifts off to sleep with vertex waves and spindles. These focal features in the right posterior quadrant are not as remarkable in sleep.

MEDICATIONS:  Propofol.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long term monitoring, 6 hours EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  Wakefulness and sleep were recorded.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  After 10:00 at night until 6:00 in the morning from November 6 to November 7, 2011 there was marked muscle and multielectrode artifact to almost impossible reading the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record at the beginning opens to a diffusely slow low amplitude recording with no clear posterior dominant rhythm.  By 2 hours into the recording faster frequencies can be seen and improvement of the EEG to baseline was seen.  At best the posterior dominant rhythm reaches 8 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of frontal central beta seen.  Some sleep architecture is seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Occasional bursts of polyspike and generalized spike and waves seen at 4.5 to 5 Hz with anterior predominance  symmetrically over both hemispheres.  None of the bursts last more than 1 second.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz and 20-60 mV amplitude.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized spikes and waves.
Polyspikes and excessive theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The EEG findings are consistent with those of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.  In addition, there is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  In this patient it is likely due, at least in part, to medication effect.  No seizures were seen.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively low voltage.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, producing an increase in the amplitude of the background.  At that time, a low voltage 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm is identified bilaterally.  Despite movement artifact, there is a glimpse of a left mid-to-anterior temporal region in HV.  This is followed by a drowsy pattern at which point there is some subtle focal slowing discernable in the left anteriotemporal region.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, he begins to snore, again producing a fair amount of artifact.  Other features of sleep include some vertex activity.   In sleep, well-defined left anteriotemporal spike and slow wave complexes are identified.  The patient remains asleep during photic stimulation, with features of stage II sleep and spindles, but no clear driving.  In this sleep state, during HV, the left anteriotemporal spike and slow wave complexes are better defined and then the patient briefly awakens towards the end of HV.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anteriotemporal spike and slow wave activity.
Left anteriotemporal focal slowing.
Low voltage, somewhat slow background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Despite the technical challenges described above, this EEG is similar to a previous record with focal temporal epileptiform activity.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is completed. The patient is recorded in a somewhat stiff position. Wakefulness and sleep are identified.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes limited wakefulness but in wakefulness there is a low voltage, 10 Hertz alpha rhythm. Much of the record includes drowsiness with at times rhythmic slowing from the left frontocentral region in wakefulness. Features of drowsiness include rhythmic bilateral slowing and then some vertex waves. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

HR: 60bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic left frontotemporal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Epileptiform activity is less prominent in this EEG than seen in previous but previous EEGs have identified a left temporal focus with the characteristic rhythmic temporal slowing described above. Other studies identified sharp waves.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is awake.  There is a 9 to 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a fair amount of eye artifact.   Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and does elicit some left anteriotemporal sharp and slow wave complexes in association with hyperventilation. Following hyperventilation, the patient becomes somewhat drowsy and there is a small amount of slowing in the left mid-temporal region in this somewhat drowsy pattern.  There is also a high amplitude left anteriotemporal spike and slow wave complex.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is a left anteriotemporal spike component, but this has a bifrontal field.  This activity can be reviewed with other montages where again it seems to be primarily left temporal with some spread into the eye movement channel.  It is prominent with almost a focal spike and wave component as the patient becomes drowsy and reaches stage II sleep.  Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is in stage II sleep and does not significantly activate the record.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There is limited maximal wakefulness with a well-defined alpha rhythm.  The alpha frequency is 12 Hz, 30 to 50 uV and is slightly higher amplitude on the left compared to the right.  Much of the record includes drowsiness or sleep with slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  In the transition to sleep, there is a drowsy pattern with rhythmic theta, which is identified bilaterally and is symmetric.  There is a slight amplitude asymmetry on some occasions as slowing develops in the record, with again slightly higher amplitude slowing from the left compared to the right.  Vertex waves in stage I sleep are symmetric.  POSTS are identified bilaterally.

Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, producing an increase in background beta.  Notably, at baseline, the patient’s heart rate is 72 BPM and irregular.  In hyperventilation, the heart rate becomes more irregular, increasing to 96 BPM and is associated with the feeling of light-headedness and a twitchy feeling.  The twitchy feeling is identified at 13:51.  No epileptiform features are identified at that time, although there is an increase in background beta.

Photic stimulation elicits a driving response bilaterally.  The driving response is quite vigorous, but in the slower frequency flash stimuli, it is higher amplitude and more prominent from the left compared to the right.

HR:  72 BPM, irregular.

IMPRESSION: Given the presence of an alpha asymmetry and the amplitude asymmetry, as well as the photic asymmetry, this is a mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. The amplitude asymmetry comparing the left to the right and the slightly asymmetric photic stimulation.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  In this individual with a history of childhood head trauma, these findings should be correlated with imaging.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz, 30 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. In wakefulness, there is a small intrahemispheric asymmetry with accentuation of fast activity in the right frontocentral region compared to the left.  This is compatible with a breach rhythm.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.  During hyperventilation, the background EEG demonstrates an awake pattern with an increase in the amplitude and a small increase in theta.  Notably, in hyperventilation, the heart rate increases from 70 to 90 BPM.  The patient reports experiencing the typical symptoms of one of his events.
Photic stimulation is remarkable for a driving response.  The patient’s breach rhythm is somewhat more prominent during photic.
HR:  70 to 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In view of the breach rhythm, which is a manifestation of a previous skull defect, the amplitude asymmetries and the beta asymmetries are anticipated findings.  As was seen in a previous EEG, the patient again felt tachycardic during hyperventilation and again demonstrated an increase in heart rate.
Additional, neurocardiac monitoring may be helpful to further characterize his spells.

MEDICATIONS:   Motrin, Ativan, Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement  with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, background  EEG demonstrates an interhemispheric asymmetry. The left hemisphere is appropriately  organized with 9 Hz 50 mV posterior dominant rhythm. The right hemisphere  is characterized  by intermittent arrhythmic delta. Although, much of the faster frequency activity persists with periodic, right centrotemporal sharp waves with a field of spread essentially throughout the entire right hemisphere. These vary in terms of the periodicity, but do not evolve to seizures. If the patient becomes drowsy, they become lower amplitude with more a pattern of sharply contoured delta. Deeper stages of sleep are characterized  by an increase in beta frequency activity. The patient is easily
stimulated with an awake pattern from the left and a periodic sharply contoured  slowing from the
right.
HR: 	96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram:
1. 	Right-sided focal slowing.
2. 	Periodic, high-amplitude  right temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORR ELATION:
This EEG supports a structural abnormality  on the right involving
gray and white matter. The periodic sharp waves support cortical irritability. This is a highly irritative pattern that raises concerns for ongoing seizures.  These results were reviewed with clinical team on 10/12/2007.

delta. Activity is slightly higher on the right. Through the course of the record, intermittent
attenuations are observed and there is a fair amount of waxing and waning although the close -
of the record does seem to be better then the beginning. There is some sharp slowing observed
in the right mid to anterior temporal region with an after going slow wave observed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9.8 Hz alpha rhythm. A
breach rhythm is identified on the right with higher amplitude beta activity in that region and very subtle low voltage delta in the right centrotemporal region. Prominent wicket is noted in relaxed wakefulness. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing an increase in the amplitude, accentuating the breach rhythm and to a slight extent the focal slowing in the right centrotemporal region. Features of drowsiness
included an increase in amplitude of the background, a small amount of wicket, and again, a slight accentuation of the focal slowing in the right centrotemporal region. Deeper stages of sleep include stage I sleep with bilateral vertex waves. Photic stimulation produces bilateral driving.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel  EKG. Patient is somnolent but moving about and answering questions.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a slow pattern bilaterally with theta-delta pattern.  In addition, superimposed upon this is a rhythmic delta from the right posterior quadrant and in this region there is also a sharp wave in the right posterotemporal region.

The patient has a seizure while working with the tech. The seizure seems to begin while the tech is working with the patient and the first ictal changes are at 15:48. The ictal changes include an increase in theta frequency activity.

By 01:49:00 very clear ictal changes are noted with the patient looking, instead of at the right, he is looking at the left and blinking. He remains responsive to the technologist at
0:48:55 as this activity builds up.  He seems to be confused, but he does follow commands and closes his eyes at 0:49:14. The tech is working with the patient so she does not observe the rhythmic repetitive theta activity in the right temporal region which spreads to the parietal and occipital region as well. He stops speaking, though.  By
15:50 the physician comes to examine the patient who is clearly confused and unable to follow commands, with roving eye movements.   He does provide a few words at
15:50:33. This electrographic seizure has a clear end at 15:51:11 and likely onset gradual evolution of faster frequencies at 15:48 for a total seizure duration of approximately 3 minutes.

Afterwards, the EEG returns to its previous, slower periodic sharp wave from the right hemisphere which gradually build up at 15:54:03.   Facial twitching is noted.

The second seizure is a grand mal seizure but starts with facial twitching and actually has a complex partial component where the patient actually seems to be somewhat

responsive and uncomfortable with focal and then asynchronous twitching. The second seizure is significantly longer in duration.  The tonic-clonic section of it is still relatively prolonged and is at least4  seconds in duration.

After the second seizure which has the tonic-clonic components, the overall EEG is quite slow but the periodic complexes in the right posterior quadrant persist.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is actually increasingly awake and responsive during the EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is remarkable for a fair amount of muscle movement artifact. There is a beta frequency background on the left with generous beta.  There is irregular activity in the right hemisphere with arrhythmic delta activity with variable maximum, including frontal temporal, posterior temporal, or right central/central temporal.  Arrhythmic delta accompanies this. Later portions in the record, when the patient is a bit more awake, seem to be associated with a bit less of this activity, but it  is relatively continuous.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due:
1.	Generalized background slowing.
2.	Superimposed focal slowing on the right.
3. 	Sharp waves from the right, including right central temporal.


CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	This EEG supports a highly irritative focus in the right hemisphere.  Given the fever, nuchal rigidity, and abnormal CSF, these findings should be interpreted in the context of clinical and imaging data.

TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.5 Hertz 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  Abundant stage I sleep includes POSTS



Sleep is not sustained



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and sleep study.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  During wakefulness, there is a disorganized background. The posterior dominant rhythm reaches at the start 6 Hz and up to 35 microvolts. As the record continues and patient reaches maximal wakefulness during stimulation, the background rhythm reaches at its maximum 9 Hz. There is an interhemispheric asymmetry seen with some focal slowing of the right hemisphere.  Sleep is seen with vertex waves and spindles and a little epochs of sleep, where the patient quickly awakens.  Hyperventilation accentuates the focal slowing in the right hemisphere.  Photic stimulation shows some scant driving, which is seen a bit better on the right posterior hemisphere.
HR:  66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Generalized slowing of the background, which does reach 9 Hz, but the majority of the background is slow.
2. 	More focal slowing seen in the right hemisphere.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is no epileptiform activity seen in this record. The generalized slowing of the background is nonspecific.  Initially, the focal slowing is seen in the right hemisphere,  but the driving is actually better in the right hemisphere,  which is incongruent and not initially expected.  The focal differences could be secondary to a structural abnormality and could get imaging this patient.  Clinical correlation is recommended.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  The EKG electrode does not show a very good rhythm, a very low amplitude rhythm.  In addition, the impedances on the occipital electrodes and the right frontal and central electrodes were very high due to difficulty with the patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a recording that is mainly in sleep.  The patient is aroused at one point during the study and there appears to be a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8 Hz, mainly seen over the right hemisphere, but for a short duration, again in the setting of electrode with a high impedance.

EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.7

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial sections of much of the waking record unfortunately includes head rocking artifact in the posterior regions. There is a 10.5 hertz alpha rhythm which is higher amplitude on the right than the left and posterior activity is always higher amplitude on the right than the left in this individual. Brief stage II sleep includes vertex waves, spindles and POSTS. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response, but the driving response is somewhat asymmetric, more vigorous on the left compared to the right. In addition, there is also a suggestion of a subharmonic driving response elicited on the left more so than the right.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Equivocally abnormal EEG due to:
1. Asymmetric photic stimulation described above.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The head rocking artifact is in the same region as the area of potential abnormality. A somewhat asymmetric photic stimulation is not necessarily pathological and some of the features that this patient demonstrated are compatible with normal variant. To more completely evaluate her epilepsy, a follow up study with more extended sleep is suggested.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively low voltage with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. It is difficult to define an alpha rhythm in this background. Hyperventilation is performed with good effort producing an increase in amplitude of the background. Drowsiness is characterized by the appearance of lower voltage theta and delta. As the patient drifts into sleep in this low voltage record, some of the delta appears to be a bit more prominent in the left hemisphere. Photic stimulation elicits scan driving in this low voltage record.

1. Replacement of normal background with more of a low voltage beta frequency pattern.
2. Focal slowing from the left hemisphere.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified today. In this low voltage record, the presence of the focal slowing on the left relevant to the right correlates with the previous craniotomy and neuropathology. No epileptiform activity seen since 2003.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background activity was characterized by absence of a clear posterior dominant rhythm and a very low amplitude voltage recording.  There is a diffuse beta activity seen throughout the recording.  Stage 1 sleep is characterized by disappearance of a muscle and eye blink artifact and the presence of vertex sharp waves.  Stage 2 sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.  Some focal slow waves are noted at anterior, temporal, and central area on the left side with some increase in faster frequencies at times.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to left frontocentral slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left frontocentral region, which is consistent with the known surgery.  The absence of a normal posterior dominant rhythm, although atypical could be a normal variant.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.

He is able to push the button for all of the events that he experiences. He has multiple episodes of dizziness or disorienting feeling.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 hertz posterior dominant rhythm which is symmetrically reactive. Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background theta with vertex waves, spindles and stage II sleep. There is an epoch in which REM sleep is seen.
In the interictal EEG, there is a single left temporal sharp wave.
Events: The patient has multiple dizzy spells including 129, 125, 312, 336, 536, 546 and then there are no additional push buttons noted.
Although not all of the seizures have a clear clinical correlate and some have only either subtle theta or subtle disruption of faster frequency activity in left temporal region, some have clear, rhythmic 4 hertz theta from the left temporal region with some spread to the frontocentral region bilaterally, typically lasting 20-40 seconds. The patient receives Depakote at 2:20p.m., the discharges are briefer, more evanescent more allusive.

INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is remarkably low voltage with a 9.7 hertz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta. Mu rhythm is noted, but testing is not performed to confirm this. The Mu activity is 10 hertz. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Vertex waves are observed in stage I sleep. The vertex waves are to the right of the midline. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A consistent pattern of vertex waves phase reversing to the right of the midline.
Because of this single abnormality, these findings may be an artifact. Therefore, it is recommended that this EEG be reported to make sure that this is in fact a biological phenomenon. The asymmetric vertex waves could be correlated with exam and imaging should there be a focal process.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement as well as anterotemporal electrodes and EKG electrodes.  The EEG was recorded with photic stimulation and hyperventilation was performed.  Sleep stage I and stage II were recorded.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Frequent bilateral temporalis muscle artifact seen during the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontal central beta.  Sleep stage I and stage II is recorded.  Photic stimulation and hyperventilation presented no abnormal discharges.

Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists primarily of diffuse polymorph ic theta activity with underriding beta activity and overriding prominent polymorphic slow delta activity. Right frontocentral region contains frequent subtle stereotyped runs of activity that are concerning for electrographic
seizures. These runs start with right frontocentral (Fp2, F4, C4) medium amplitude fast activity that evolves into - 6 Hz rhythmic sharply contoured theta activity that spreads towards midline (Cz lead) and posteriorly (P4 lead). These runs last - 20-30 seconds and occur frequently throughout the recording. There is no obvious clinical correlate. During drowsiness, EMG artifact disappears.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed. Summary of  Findings:
Status epilepticus, right, frontocentral Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 22-minutes awake and drowsy portable EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and recurrent brief runs of stereotyped activity that are concerning for recurrent seizures (partial status epilepticus)  Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction , which is etiologically nonspecific.

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:





A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and an excess
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing with diffuse theta are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric POSTS, sleep
spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:




This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

Excess beta activity can be seen in the setting of a medication effect (i.e., benzodiazepines or
barbiturates).

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively low voltage with generous beta and a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  With testing the alpha improves to 10 Hz.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  Wicket is noted in relaxed wakefulness. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record.  The patient is falling asleep during hyperventilation with vertex waves and spindles.  There are some normal variants, including small sharp spikes of sleep, but there is also some left temporal focal slowing.  The patient transitions in and out of stage II sleep.  Again, subtle left temporal focal slowing is noted.  Simple sharp waves, as are common in normal variants, are also noted in the left temporal region. These are again noted with photic stimulation.  The patient is once again falling asleep during photic stimulation.

HR:    60 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Subtle left temporal focal slowing.
2. Left temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The left temporal sharp waves have a simple morphology as can be seen in a normal variant.  However, they occur in the context of focal slowing and are more suggestive of a focal mechanism for epilepsy.  In comparison to a previous EEG, both EEGs demonstrate some of the same normal variants and some of the same unique challenges.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that best reaches 7 Hz and which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is a lack of normal frontocentral beta.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.  Throughout the recording, there appears to be diffuse generalized theta, 5 to 7 Hz discharge, that is intermixed with bursts of high-amplitude delta seen bilaterally with multiple sharp components throughout those discharges that last, at times, up to 30 to 40 seconds.  There is no clear evolution or change during these discharges.  The morphology is consistent with triphasic waves, but there are some intermixed sharp waves that we will discuss in ""abnormal discharges"" below.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen independently at F7/T3, as well as F8/T4, and at times FP2.

In addition, there was evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology, but may be due at least in part to medication effect.  The excess beta supports a possibility of benzo or barbiturate use as a cause of the diffuse dysfunction.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a background, which appears to have diffuse beta and mainly in sleep.  There is no clear posterior dominant rhythm, but this may be obscured by the diffuse beta.  Overall, the patient easily drowses off and is in limited wakefulness.  During hyperventilation, there appears to be some bursts of rhythmic bifrontal slowing.  Photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient reaches stage I and stage II sleep.  Please note that at times there is also rhythmic bursts of theta, which are anterior maximal, which are most consistent with drowsiness, however, some of them have a slightly suspicious appearance.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and asleep EEG.  The excessive beta seen may be due at least in part to medication effect.  Please note that even though no clear posterior dominant rhythm could be seen, this may be due to the excessive beta, and in addition, the rhythmic anterior theta is likely due to drowsiness, however, if clinical suspicion for epilepsy remains, a more prolonged EEG may be helpful in elucidating or clarifying the diagnosis.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a bedside record without hyperventilation and photic stimulation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there was a 10Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in beta.

In wakefulness, there were bursts of frontally predominant rhythmic high amplitude 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity.

No impairment of awareness was noted with the events.  The patient was able to answer questions even with very brief discharges, but again discharges are typically 1 to 1.5 seconds after going slow activity, lasting an another second at maximum duration.

The technologist notes 1 or 2 movements of the patient, but no definitive myoclonus was captured.

system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Fragments of a
symmetric posterior dominant rhythm are likely present, but interpretation is limited by near constant
eye movement artifact during wakefulness, including nystagmus artifact.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.





OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


1. A single left occipital sharply contoured theta wave is noted in drowsiness, not clearly epileptiform



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.  There was a technical limitation with the T6 electrode which persisted even after it was fixed by the technician.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 9.5 Hz in frequency and 20-40 microvolts in amplitude best seen in the occipital region which attenuates with eye opening.  In drowsiness there is diffuse rhythmic theta bursts in all the channels.

There is an occasional burst of focal slowing seen in the left frontocentral region.

Hyperventilation was performed which showed a diffuse slowing of the record and increase in amplitude.

Photic stimulation showed minimal driving at 13 Hz but no abnormalities.

Heart rate 60 beats per minute.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to occasional bursts of focal slowing on the left frontocentral and frontotemporal regions.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is suggestive of a possible underlying structural abnormality in the left frontocentral and frontotemporal regions.  No epileptiform discharges were identified.  A more prolonged EEG recording may be more helpful to identify spikes or sharp waves.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  At 11:22:17 a.m., there is a seizure onset at 9-10 Hz alpha activity, maximum in left occipital region (01) with spread to left posterior quadrant and right occipital region, after 20 seconds seizure activity continues as 4-5 Hz theta activity maximum in left posterior quadrant for 40 seconds.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  At 11:22:17 a.m., there is a seizure onset at 9-10 Hz alpha activity, maximum in left occipital region (01) with spread to left posterior quadrant and right occipital region, after 20 seconds seizure activity continues as 4-5 Hz theta activity maximum in left posterior quadrant for 40 seconds.  This activity was followed by sharply contoured delta activity with bihemispheric distribution for 90 seconds.  It was followed by postictal attenuation noted in bihemispheric region.  Clinically, patient did not show shaking or jerking, but per video patient seemed less responsive with eyes closed.  Towards the end of this recording, there were left periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges noted in left posterior quadrant region lasting for several minutes with no evolution. There was almost continuous left posterior quadrant slowing almost continuous noted during this recording.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to;
1. Electrographic partial seizure originating from left occipital/left posterior quadrant region.
2. Left posterior quadrant slowing.
3. Left periodic lateralized epileptiform

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Focal slowing is a consistent with functional or structural abnormality in left posterior quadrant. PLEDs (Periodic Lateralized Epileptiform Discharges) are consistent with left hemisphere structural lesion (tumor, infection, and stroke). It could also be due to a post-ictal state. One episode of electrographic focal seizure is consistent with partial epilepsy in the setting of Hx of seizure. Clinical correlation and long-term monitoring are recommended.

Seizures previously described as tonic-clonic seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Pentasa, methotrexate, Celexa, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Impedances were acceptable, although T1 and T2 electrodes slightly greater than 5 kohms.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a low voltage, 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  In the initial sections of the record there is frequent eye blink, but there is also a subtle area of sharply contoured slowing in the right mid temporal region at T2 and T4.  Hyperventilation is performed slightly after this finding is noted and produces an increase in amplitude, an increase in beta and does not clearly accentuate this finding which is noted again as the patient becomes drowsy with slow rolling eye movements.  This subtle lower voltage focal slowing in the right mid to posterior temporal region has almost a periodicity and when there is some overlying alpha frequency activity there is appearance of a low voltage sharp but without an after going slow wave.  It persisted into drowsiness with an increase in beta but deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
The patient was relatively drowsy during photic stimulation which did elicit a driving response.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to right mid to posterior temporal focal slowing at times sharply contoured with a frequency of approximately 4 Hz.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are very similar to the previous study 05/13/2013.  There is a slight periodicity of the focal slowing.  These findings contrast to previous EEGs in childhood which are reported to have demonstrated generalized spike and wave activity.

INTRODUCTION:  Routine 21-channel EEG was performed utilizing the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement along with hyperventilation and photic stimulation EKG and EOG monitoring.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The white cresting background reveals a large amount of 50-70 microvolt amplitude posterior alpha rhythm with a large amount of 18-30 Hz low voltage of her frontocentral regions.  Large amount of eye blink artifacts were seen throughout much of the waking record.  Moderate amount of muscle artifact was also seen.  With eye opening, there was attenuation of alpha activity.  Periods of drowsiness were seen with attenuation of posterior rhythmic activity and increased slow to medium amount due to symmetric irregular slowing.  Hyperventilation for 3 minutes produced mild increased low to medium amounts.  Bilateral delta and theta frequency slowing.  Photic stimulation was accompanied by symmetric occipital driving.  EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm at 60 per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy EEG.  A normal EEG cannot exclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  If clinically indicated, a sleep deprived tracing capturing stage II sleep or more prolonged ambulatory EEG may provide additional information.

INTRODUCTION:  Routine 24-minute outpatient digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  Impedances were acceptable under 5 kilohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is abnormal.  At best, there is an 8 Hz alpha rhythm but there is excess background theta.  In addition, there are occasional bursts of background delta some of which are a bit more posteriorly predominant.  Hyperventilation was performed early in the record and accentuated this finding.  As the patient became drowsy after hyperventilation, there was some shifting arrhythmic slowing a bit more prominent in the posterior regions.  Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.

HEART RATE:  40 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Bursts of frontal slow delta.
3. Occasional shifting occipital slowing.
4. Bradycardia.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  To put this EEG in the proper context, it is important to know when this patient had his most recent seizures.  This may represent a postictal finding.  Comparison with previous EEGs is suggested.

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:




The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with poor cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode
placement with 1 channel EKG. Impedances were acceptable aside from the T1-T2 electrodes.
Electrode placement was perhaps suboptimal due to some or the features of the vertex waves.
DESCRIPTION OF THE As the tracing begins, the patient is asleep. Features of stage 1 and
stage 2 sleep are noted with vertex activity and spindles. Intermittent bursts of delta were noted. There
is prominent beta. There is a slight asymmetry noted with a bit of slowing noted on the left with a bit more
delta on the left relative to the right Eye movement and EKG artifacts as well were noted 10 the
background.

Hyperventilation was performed early in the record. Hyperventilation clearly accentuates focal slowing
from the left hemisphere, and in hyperventilation, discrete left temporal sharp waves emerge. As the
hyperventilation concludes, the patient drifts off back to sleep with generous beta and again focal slowing
noted from the left. In more prolonged stage II sleep, some of the vertex waves and spindles are slightly
asymmetric. Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting off to sleep. II does not
significantly activate the record, but the focal sharp waves and focal slowing persist In sleep, there are
some lower voltage, discreet bilateral spikes noted with a bit of a field to the left.
At the close of the record, the patient is transitioning back into stage II sleep, but limited wakefulness was
identified with a symmetric brief posterior dominant rhythm.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal stowing from the left temporal region.
2. Discrete fell temporal spikes.
3. A number of discrete, bifrontal spikes.
4. Hypersomnolence.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Th1s EEG supports a structural or functional process on the left with focal
epileptiform features These findings may be correlated with Imaging
This patients medications should also include Remeron and Abilify.

Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;






- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


(9) there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is
not a ""low risk"" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Additionally, T1, F9, T9, P9, T2, F10, T10, and P10 electrodes were placed in this patient.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 8 hours each day the
patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in person or on call 24
hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with
special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a technician was not
available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed
seizure testing and electrode maintenance.





The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named ""Stellate"") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is
characterized by a posterior dominant rhythm consisting of low voltage fast frequencies.  Lambda
waves are seen in wakefulness.








During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric POSTS, vertex
waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes.



No generalized slowing is present. No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed



EVENTS:

The daytime technician told the rounding team that ""around 2 am"" on 6/15 the patient got out of
bed to use the bathroom and reported dizziness and right sided numbness.  The entire record was
reviewed, end-to-end, with particular attention to arousals from 01:45-03:00.  The patient remained
asleep with normal background.




HEART RATE:


A heart rate in the 80s is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep video EEG. There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG. A posterior dominant rhythm consisting of low
voltage fast frequencies can be a normal variant in the adult population.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.




DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Normal study.

Episode that was reported around 2 am on 6/15/2016 has no EEG correlate.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:



INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patients interictal findings were normal, with a posterior dominant
rhythm consisting of low voltage fast frequencies, without any focal findings or epileptiform
discharges.



ICTAL FINDINGS:


The patient had 2 clinical events that were representative of her typical habitual events at home.
They were semiologically and electrographically consistent with nonepileptic behavioral events.
Two additional clinical events of  ""dizziness with right sided numbness"" also had no electrographic
correlate, and also consistent with nonepileptic events.




SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. Nonepileptic behavioral events



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Nonepileptic behavioral events



CONCLUSION:

The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 5 days with continuous video EEG.  This
was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of events.



The interictal EEG is normal.








The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of his admission. As the EEG remained normal
without focal features or epileptiform discharges, the patient was counseled about the diagnosis of
nonepileptic behavioral events and that Keppra is not indicated to treat these.  She is to continue off
Keppra.




We recommend that she to see a psychiatrist or therapist for assessment of underlying
psychopathology and diagnosis.

This is a 42 y.o. left handed female admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG)
monitoring with a history of: paroxysmal events of unclear etiology.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;






- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


(9) there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is
not a ""low risk"" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Additionally, T1, F9, T9, P9, T2, F10, T10, and P10 electrodes were placed in this patient.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 8 hours each day the
patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in person or on call 24
hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with
special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a technician was not
available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed
seizure testing and electrode maintenance.





The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named ""Stellate"") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

This is a 42 y.o. left handed female admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG)
monitoring with a history of: paroxysmal events of unclear etiology.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;






- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


(9) there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is
not a ""low risk"" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Additionally, T1, F9, T9, P9, T2, F10, T10, and P10 electrodes were placed in this patient.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 8 hours each day the
patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in person or on call 24
hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with
special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a technician was not
available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed
seizure testing and electrode maintenance.





The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named ""Stellate"") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a posterior dominant rhythm consisting of low voltage fast frequencies.  Lambda
waves are seen in wakefulness.








During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric POSTS, vertex
waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed



EVENTS:

The daytime technician told the rounding team that ""around 2 am"" on 6/15 the patient got out of
bed to use the bathroom and reported dizziness and right sided numbness.  The entire record was
reviewed, end-to-end, with particular attention to arousals from 01:45-03:00.  The patient remained
asleep with normal background.




HEART RATE:


A heart rate in the 80s is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep video EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG. A posterior dominant rhythm consisting of low
voltage fast frequencies can be a normal variant in the adult population.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.




DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Normal study.

Episode that was reported around 2 am on 6/15/2016 has no EEG correlate.

CLINICAL: Patient is lying in bed and appears uncomfortable restless; fidgeting with both hands. She
has a few isolated body jerks. She appears as though she is searching for the event button without
moving her head. She utters a few brief moans. Tech comes into room and asks ""are you ok?"" Patient
does not answer, but isolated body jerks become more frequent. Tech presses button. Body jerking,
now side-to-side, becomes higher in amplitude. Eyes are closed. Patient does not follow commands.
At 11:10, jerks increase in amplitude to become rhythmic shaking with side-to-side head movements,
which gradually decrease in frequency, become lower in amplitude, and become irregular at offset.
Patient has urinary incontinence and postictal confusion.






EEG: No EEG changes from background, aside from movement artifact, were seen preceding or
following the part of the episode that involve violent shaking. Violent shaking has only electrode
movement artifact as correlate.


DURATION: 6 min 29 sec


POSTICTAL CHANGES:  No change

EKG: heart rate increases from 90 bpm baseline to 120s immediately after shaking resolves

head ""no."" Sways back and forth with eyes closed and appears to be nauseas. She then develops
flexion-extension movements of trunk with side to side head shaking. She is able to remain seated in
the chair. Tech is able to suppress the movements with palpation. Eyes are open and fluttering.
Within 45-60 seconds shaking becomes more irregular and less violent. She does not follow
commands. She continues to have irregular low amplitude body jerks for several minutes after the
violent shaking has stopped. By 12:34 she attends and responds verbally. She cannot remember the
code word.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:



INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patients interictal findings were normal, with a posterior dominant
rhythm consisting of low voltage fast frequencies, without any focal findings or epileptiform
discharges.



ICTAL FINDINGS:


The patient had 2 clinical events that were representative of her typical habitual events at home.
They were semiologically and electrographically consistent with nonepileptic behavioral events.
Two additional clinical events of  ""dizziness with right sided numbness"" also had no electrographic
correlate, and also consistent with nonepileptic events.




SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. Nonepileptic behavioral events



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Nonepileptic behavioral events



CONCLUSION:

The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 5 days with continuous video EEG.  This
was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of events.



The interictal EEG is normal.








The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of his admission. As the EEG remained normal
without focal features or epileptiform discharges, the patient was counseled about the diagnosis of
nonepileptic behavioral events and that Keppra is not indicated to treat these.  She is to continue off
Keppra.




We recommend that she to see a psychiatrist or therapist for assessment of underlying
psychopathology and diagnosis.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:



INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patients interictal findings were normal, with a posterior dominant
rhythm consisting of low voltage fast frequencies, without any focal findings or epileptiform
discharges.



ICTAL FINDINGS:


The patient had 2 clinical events that were representative of her typical habitual events at home.
They were semiologically and electrographically consistent with nonepileptic behavioral events.
Two additional clinical events of  ""dizziness with right sided numbness"" also had no electrographic
correlate, and also consistent with nonepileptic events.




SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. Nonepileptic behavioral events



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Nonepileptic behavioral events



CONCLUSION:

The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 5 days with continuous video EEG.  This
was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of events.



The interictal EEG is normal.








The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of his admission. As the EEG remained normal
without focal features or epileptiform discharges, the patient was counseled about the diagnosis of
nonepileptic behavioral events and that Keppra is not indicated to treat these.  She is to continue off
Keppra.




We recommend that she to see a psychiatrist or therapist for assessment of underlying
psychopathology and diagnosis.

This is a 42 y.o. left handed female admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG)
monitoring with a history of: paroxysmal events of unclear etiology.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;






- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


(9) there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is
not a ""low risk"" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Additionally, T1, F9, T9, P9, T2, F10, T10, and P10 electrodes were placed in this patient.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 8 hours each day the
patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in person or on call 24
hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with
special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a technician was not
available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed
seizure testing and electrode maintenance.





The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named ""Stellate"") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is
characterized by a posterior dominant rhythm consisting of low voltage fast frequencies.  Lambda
waves are seen in wakefulness.








During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric POSTS, vertex
waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes.



No generalized slowing is present. No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed



EVENTS:

The daytime technician told the rounding team that ""around 2 am"" on 6/15 the patient got out of
bed to use the bathroom and reported dizziness and right sided numbness.  The entire record was
reviewed, end-to-end, with particular attention to arousals from 01:45-03:00.  The patient remained
asleep with normal background.




HEART RATE:


A heart rate in the 80s is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep video EEG. There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG. A posterior dominant rhythm consisting of low
voltage fast frequencies can be a normal variant in the adult population.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.




DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Normal study.

Episode that was reported around 2 am on 6/15/2016 has no EEG correlate.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a posterior dominant rhythm consisting of low voltage fast frequencies.  Lambda
waves are seen in wakefulness.








During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric POSTS, vertex
waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed



EVENTS:

The daytime technician told the rounding team that ""around 2 am"" on 6/15 the patient got out of
bed to use the bathroom and reported dizziness and right sided numbness.  The entire record was
reviewed, end-to-end, with particular attention to arousals from 01:45-03:00.  The patient remained
asleep with normal background.




HEART RATE:


A heart rate in the 80s is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep video EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG. A posterior dominant rhythm consisting of low
voltage fast frequencies can be a normal variant in the adult population.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.




DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Normal study.

Episode that was reported around 2 am on 6/15/2016 has no EEG correlate.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:



INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patients interictal findings were normal, with a posterior dominant
rhythm consisting of low voltage fast frequencies, without any focal findings or epileptiform
discharges.



ICTAL FINDINGS:


The patient had 2 clinical events that were representative of her typical habitual events at home.
They were semiologically and electrographically consistent with nonepileptic behavioral events.
Two additional clinical events of  ""dizziness with right sided numbness"" also had no electrographic
correlate, and also consistent with nonepileptic events.




SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. Nonepileptic behavioral events



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Nonepileptic behavioral events



CONCLUSION:

The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 5 days with continuous video EEG.  This
was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of events.



The interictal EEG is normal.








The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of his admission. As the EEG remained normal
without focal features or epileptiform discharges, the patient was counseled about the diagnosis of
nonepileptic behavioral events and that Keppra is not indicated to treat these.  She is to continue off
Keppra.




We recommend that she to see a psychiatrist or therapist for assessment of underlying
psychopathology and diagnosis.

Mother reports abrupt onset of head bobbing, arm shaking, and episodes with loss of consciousness for the past 48 hours.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  A 30-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient had limited communication skills and a translator was used during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is awake with a 12 hertz alpha rhythm generous, low voltage, frontal central beta.
In wakefulness and early drowsiness, brief bursts of high amplitude, generalized spike and wave activity were noted.  Some of these seem to begin with a burst of fast activity in the occipital regions with a 3-5 Hz spike and wave complex.  The complexes vary in the frequency, many of them are 3 hertz with a polyspike, but the later spikes in the complex are always consistently slower.  Generally, these are frontally predominant spike and wave complexes and those that occur out of drowsiness do not have this beta buzz prior to the spikes.  The patient is noted to have a subtle head bob and sometimes some movement of her legs during the bursts.  She seems to have clinical symptoms with bursts that are 2 seconds in duration.  The bursts are present in wakefulness and early drowsiness.  Hyperventilation may have increase the duration of the spike and wave and polyspike and wave complexes.  In addition, during hyperventilation, there may be a little bit more fast activity.  The patient was otherwise able to answer questions, before and after the discharges.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response.  Spike and wave activity was noted with a 21 hertz discharge, but was not prolonged relative to other sections of the record.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to generalized spike and wave activity with bursts of 3-5 Hz frontally predominant spike and wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The EEG pattern described above is most compatible with generalized mechanism for epilepsy.  The patient's behavior of the head bobbing and sometimes the leg movements are not outside of normal for a absence seizure.

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 12Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  There is diffuse excess beta.  During drowsiness, the background slows to

attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.

Patient subsequently received tramadol for a fracture and had a tonic-clonic seizure.  The patient was started on carbamazepine and since then, complains of feeling spacey.
INTRODUCTION:  One-hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient has received levetiracetam 1000 mg during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the background EEG is diffusely slow with an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm, but with excess beta and bursts of theta.  Bursts of frontally predominant spike and wave activity are noted.  In addition, isolated right or left frontal spike and wave discharges are noted.  Some of these demonstrate a prominence in the right hemisphere.  Hyperventilation was performed early in the record and clearly accentuates frontally predominant spike and wave activity.  The spike and wave activity ranges from 3 to 5 hertz in frequency.   Discharges are not sustained with most spike and wave complexes either isolated or occurring in bursts, less than 1.5 seconds duration.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting off to sleep.  This spike and wave discharges did not seem to be augmented by the photic stimulation, but as the patient transitions to sleep, there was a higher amplitude, frontally predominant slowing with a bit more slow spike and wave activity.  Levetiracetam was given at approximately 12 p.m. and the EEG was recorded until 12:41.  Following the levetiracetam, by 12:30, there did appear to be a decrease in the spike and wave activity.  The paroxysmal slowing was a little less remarkable and while the EEG remained abnormal with excess theta, the overall pattern was improving.  The alpha rhythm was at 8.3 hertz at conclusion.
Heart rate, slightly irregular at 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Initially markedly abnormal background with excess slowing and disorganized pattern, improving towards the close of the record.
Frontally predominant spike and slow wave activity.
Focal spike and slow wave activity with a predominance further on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG may represent a focal or a secondary generalized mechanism for epilepsy.  There was a small degree of irregularity in the heart rate noted in the final pages of the EEG, which may be evaluated by different mechanisms.

TECHNIQUE:

A   1 hour video Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9  Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.  Supra harmonic driving was noted, although the
patient was transitioning into stage II sleep




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.  The patient was awake, chewing on
her hands with a great deal of muscle and other artifact throughout the EEG




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by  a slow pattern symmetric mixture of alpha and beta
frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 5-7Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  There is excess beta, excess
theta, and also a great deal of muscle artifact.  The beta activity is quite prominent in the central
regions





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not achieved



Modest generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.

TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically suboptimal
record secondary to muscle artifact and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is notable for excessive muscle artifact and eye blink artifact during much of
the tracing. Video recording also demonstrated that the patient was opening and closing her mouth
frequently. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric low voltage 8-9 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Low amplitude fairly generalized
beta activity was seen as well, maximum over frontocentral temporal regions.





During drowsiness, attenuation of amplitude and diffuse background slowing are seen.

SMALL ONE TODAY .





MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

divalproex (DEPAKOTE ER) 500 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth every 12 hours for 360
days.

levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg tablet, Take 1.5 tablets by mouth 2 times daily for 360 days.

VITAMIN D 1,000 unit Tablet,

PHENYTOIN SODIUM EXTENDED (DILANTIN PO), Take  by mouth.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
